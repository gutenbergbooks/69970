tokens of a very wholesome and healthfull yéere, which will euer follow

<span class="sidenote" id="The_preseruation_of_health">The preseruation of health.</span>

<p>Now for the preseruation of your health, and to preuent all such
sickenesses as are incident to follow in these casuall and daungerous
yéeres: through euery seuerall moneth in the yéere you shall obserue
these few precepts.</p>

<p>First, in the month of Ianuary you shall forbeare to let bloud, vnlesse
vpon violent extreamitie, &amp; that the signes be excéeding good for the
same, you shall drinke white wine in the morning fasting, &amp; rub your
head with a course Towell very hard, but yet cleane, for it is a most
wholesom friction.</p>

<p>In the month of February, you shall not let bloud for wantonnesse, but
néede: you shall forbeare Hearbe-pottage, for at that time onely they
are least wholesome: you shall kéepe the soles of your féete from wet,
and vse euery morning your former friction.</p>

<p>In the moneth of March, the signe being good, you may let bloud
according to your youth, strength, and necessitie: you may take hot and
swéet meats and drinkes, especially Almonds, Figs &amp; Reyzins, &amp; vse also
your former friction.</p>

<p>In the month of Aprill, you may bléed as in the month of March: in it
also you may purge, by the order of a learned directer: let your dyet
be hot and fresh meats, and your drinke temperate: also in this moneth
your former friction is excéeding wholesome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>In the month of May be no sluggard, for the bed is vnwholesome,
cléerified Way is this moneth a most soueraigne drinke, and Sage
with swéet Butter is a most excellent breakefast: yong Lettuce is an
approued good Sallet, and the inthrals or offall of Beasts would by all
meanes be refused, it is also good to let bloud in this month onely for
necessitie, and not for pleasure, and beware by all means, not to go
wetshooed in the dew of the morning.</p>

<p>In the month of Iune obserue the dyet of May, or if you be of youthfull
bloud it is not amisse if it be a little cooler, and for bléeding let
it be for vrgent necessitie.</p>

<p>In the month of Iuly eschew all wanton bed-sport: and if each morning
you take of draught of clarified Butter-Milke it is very wholesome: vse
coole Iulyps, and meats that are fresh, and not stirring: now forbeare
Lettice, and bléede not, except it be in cause of great extreamitie.</p>

<p>In the month of August forbeare all manner of Worts, and Cabadges, and
generally all meats and Spices which are hot and inflaming: but by
any meanes bléed not at all, except by the direction of most approued
learning.</p>

<p>In the month of September you may eate any sort of ripe Fruits: you
may bathe in hot bathes, for colde causes, at your pleasure, and you
may let bloud according to your necessitie: those foods are best which
are of lightest disgestion, and those drinkes most wholesome which are
rather strong then scouring.</p>

<p>In the moneth of October, spare not any bloud, except great extreamitie
compell you, and for your dyet, let it be of such foods as are most
strong and nourishing, and your drinke Béere or Ale, of indifferent
strength, and now and then at the midst, and end of meales, a
draught or two of such Wines as are pleasant, strong, and wholesome:
Sallets of Flowers, preserued in Vinegar &amp; Sugar, as either Violets,
Broome-flowers, or Gelly-flowers of all kindes, or Sampyre, Purslan, or
Beane-rods, preserued in pickell, are of excellent vse, both in this
moneth, and the other two which follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>In the Moneth of Nouember open also no vaine, but for great néed,
because the blood is then gathered together into the principall
vessels: Bathing in this Moneth is vtterly to be refused, onely let
your body be kept warme, and euery colde humour or obstruction, rather
dissolued by moderate frictions, as is shewed in the moneth of Ianuary
and February, then by the violence of any other inward medicine.
Shell-Fish in this moneth is very wholesome, and so are all other sorts
of Fish, which are not too rawe or slymie.</p>

<p>In the Moneth of December blood-letting should be also forborne, except
vpon some especiall dayes, as after the fiue and twentieth day at the
soonest: and for your diet let it be meate which is hot and nourishing,
but by no meanes that which bréedeth melancholie bloud. Vse strong
Wine and sharpe Sauces: as for the warmth of your body, next vnto good
cloathing, let it euer procéed from exercise that is moderate, then
from toasting, or broiling your selfe against the fire, for in this
Month that body can hardly be sound whose shinnes are made pyde and
motley with the fiers scortching.</p>

<p>And thus much touching the experience of the English Husbandman in
these fore-knowledges, and ayming after the times to come, being
drawne from the obseruations and rules left vs by succession of times
of those learned Fathers, and other best knowne and approued in
these knowledges: yet I doe not binde euery Husbandman to make as it
were new Créeds of these Principles, but onely to giue them to his
memory, as things that will neither oppresse nor hurt it, and if in
any seldome-séene particularitie, any shall vary from the purpose of
the relation, to remember that there is aboue vs a God of all Truth
and Knowledge, who will dispose and gouerne all things, according to
his good Will and Pleasure: to which let euery Creature submit, in
as much as hee onely knoweth what is for mankinde most best and most
conuenient.</p>

it lye from the inundation of water, or be not absolutely boggy) but
with industry will beare any Fruit, Hearbe, or Flower, plentifully,
and without any casualtie procéeding from the barraines therof: witnes
a most worthy Garden in the barren Peake of <i>Darbyshire</i>, where
there is no curious Trée or Plant wanting, nor doe they flourish in any
place more brauely.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_bettering_of_Grounds">The bettering of Grounds.</span>


<p>Now for mine owne part, I write generally to all Husbandmen, not to
those onely which liue in fertile and fat Soyles, and therefore I would
haue no man say, the Soyle where I liue is so barraine, that I cannot
haue a Garden: for if the Soyle wherein you liue, be barraine, then
shall you in the latter end of September breake vp your earth more then
a Spade-graft déepe, and be well assured that at euery Spade-graft you
breake the mould well, and leaue not the rootes of any wéeds within it,
then let it rest till the midst of October, at which time if any wéeds
appeare vpon it, by all meanes let them be pluckt vp by the roots,
which done, <span class="sidenote" id="The_trenching_of_Grounds">The trenching of Grounds.</span>
you shall trench your ground at least a yarde and a halfe
déepe, and then bury in those trenches, if it be a Sand or grauell
earth, great store of Oxe or Cow meanure, if it be a colde Chalkie
Clay, or a moyst ground, then great store of Horse meanure, of both
which meanures the oldest and rottenest is the best: but if you liue in
such a Soyle as there is neyther of these meanures bred therein, then
take straw of any kinde whatsoeuer, and spread it in the high-way where
there is much trauell, &amp; when it is rotten with the beating of Horse
féet, then cause it to be shoueld vp, &amp; with it fill your trenches,
but if Straw be wanting, then if you haue any muddy ditches or ponds,
scowre the mud out of them, &amp; with it fill vp your trenches: &amp; although
these are not so long lasting as the two first sorts of meanures,
yet they are sufficient to bring forth increase, &amp; must supply where
necessity inforceth, alwayes hauing discretion when you sée your
ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> abate in fruitfulnes, to replenish it with fresh meanure.</p>

<p>Now as you fill your trenches with meanure, let one mixe the earth
therewithall, and as it were blend and incorporate them together: thus
hauing gone ouer so much ground as you intend to plant or sowe vpon,
you shall let it rest till the midst of Ianuary, at which time you
shall breake it vp in trenches againe, but not aboue thrée quarters
of a yarde déepe, and then fill vp those trenches with meanure as
before, and lay your earth as leuell as is possible, &amp; so let it rest
till the beginning of March (if the weather be seasonable for sowing
or planting) otherwise let it stay till mid-March, and as soone as the
Moone is changed you shall then dig it vp the fourth time, and make it
fit to receyue your séede, but in this fourth time of turning ouer your
earth, you shall dig it but a little better then a Spade-graft depth,
and euer as you dig it, mixe it with fresh meanure: if your ground be
subiect to much chapping or rining, then you shall at this last digging
mixe the earth with ashes and Horse meanure mixt together, which will
binde and holde the earth from chapping.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_breaking_the_Garden_moulde">Of breaking the Garden moulde.</span>


<p>After you haue digd your ground in this order, and made it leuell,
you shal with an Iron Rake breake the great clods of earth, and bring
it to as fine a mould as is possible, euer obseruing that if in the
breaking of the clods or otherwise, you perceiue the roots or stalks of
any wéeds to arise, you shall presently with your hand pull them out,
and cast them on heaps, that they may serue eyther for the fire or the
dunghill: <span class="sidenote" id="Ordering_of_Garden-beds">Ordering of Garden-beds.</span>
which done, you shall tread out your beds in such orderly
sort, that you may passe from one to the other without eyther treading
vpon the beds, or striding ouer them: &amp; thus much for the barraine &amp;
sterrill ground, which although all ancient &amp; late writers reiect, as
not worthy to be imployed to this vse, yet beléeue it, being husbanded
as is said before, it will equall in fruitfulnes the best ground.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_fruitfull_Soyle">Of the fruitfull Soyle.</span>

<p>Touching your rich and perfect grounds, which of themselues are apt
to put forth with little labour, you shall onely at the latter end
of September breake vp the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> Earth, and making greater Trenches, fill
them well with Oxe meanure, and then turning the Earth vpon the
meanure, leuell your ground very carefully, breake the clots and
rake it very painefully, and then treade out your beds, as is before
sayd, artificially; but if the ground which you breake vp, be eyther
gréene-swarth, or much ouergrowne with wéeds (as these rich soyles
must euer be the one or the other) (for they will not be idle, but
continually bringing forth) then at this first digging and dunging you
shall haue diuers which shall follow the Spade, who shall take away
all manner of roots, gréenes, grasse-tufts, stones, or whatsoeuer may
bréede anoyance to the ground: which worke being perfected, you shall
let the ground rest all winter till the beginning of March, that the
frost may mellow and ripen the mould, and also kill the roots of such
wéeds as the Spade hath turned vp, and haue béene omitted to be pulled
away.</p>

<p>Now so soone as March is come, vpon the first change of the Moone, you
shall digge vp this Earth againe, leuell it, and order it in all points
as was sayd of the barraine Earth, onely there will néede no more vse
of meanure, but as soone as it is digged, raked, leuelled, and brought
into a fine mould, you may then tread out your Beds, as aforesayd, euer
proportioning the quantitie of them according to the quantitie of your
séedes, hauing the most of that which is most in vse, and the least of
the contrary.</p>

<p>Now as touching the fencing and inclosing of your Garden, I haue in
the former Booke shewed you the same at large, and giuen seuerall
instructions, according to mens seuerall abilities, with this caution,
that whether your fence be wall, pale, dead-hedge, ditch, or quickset,
yet it must be so high that it may with assurance kéepe all manner of
Pullen from flying ouer the same, who are the greatest enemies to a
Garden that may be.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_necessariest_Ornament">The necessariest Ornament in a Garden.</span>

<p>There would be also in this Kitchin-Garden, if with conueniency it may
be brought to passe, eyther a Pumpe, Well, or Cesterne, which might
flow continually with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> water all the Summer time, for the watering of
Hearbs, as shall be héereafter declared. And thus much touching the
choyce of ground for a Kitchin-garden, and the ordering of the same.</p>

Séeds which Séeds would by no meanes be aboue a yéere olde: and hauing

which shall seuerally receiue them: you shall in this manner sowe your

take your Garden moulde, the finest that may be, being made almost as

then goe to the bedde where you meane to bestow them, and hauing newly

these:
<i>Endiue</i> and <i>Succorie</i>, which delight in moyst
ground, and will endure the winter. <i>Bleete</i> of which there be two
kindes, Red and White: this Hearbe neuer néedeth wéeding, and if he

are a finger long in their owne earth, and set them in another bed, and
they will prosper much better.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Land-Cresses">Land-Cresses.</span>

<p>Then land <i>Cresses</i>, which is both a good Pot-hearbe and a good
Sallet-Hearbe: it loueth shadowie places, where the Sunne shineth
least, and standeth in néed of little dung.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Parcely">Parcely.</span>

<p>Then <i>Parcely</i>, which of all Hearbs is of most vse, it is longest
in appearing aboue ground, and the elder séed is the quicker in growth,
but not the surer; but eyther being once come vp increase naturally,
and doe hardly euer decay: it cannot grow too thicke, but as you vse it
you must cut off the toppes with your knife, and by no meanes pull vp
the rootes: if it be put into a little pursse, and beaten against the
ground, to bruise it a little before it be sowne, it will make it haue
a large crisped leafe.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Sauory">Of Sauory.</span>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Time">Of Time.</span>

<p>Then <i>Time</i>, of which are also two kindes, the running

best euer to set them from the slip. The running <i>Time</i> doth
delight in the shadow, but the Garden <i>Time</i> in the Sunne.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="French_Mallowes">French Mallowes.</span>

<p>Then <i>Violets</i>, the leaues whereof are a good Pot-hearb, and the
Flowers preserued in close glasse pots, with strong Wine-vinegar and

grow spéedely eyther from the plant or from the séed.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Basill">Of Basill.</span>

<p>Then <i>Basill</i>, which would be sowne in the warme weather, as at
the beginning of May, for the séed is tender, and when you haue sowne
it, you shall presse the earth downe vpon it with your féet, for the
séede can endure no hollownesse: if you sowe it at the fall of the
Leafe, you shall sprinkle the séede with Vinegar, and when you water it
let the Sunne be at his height.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Sweet_Marioram">Sweet Marioram.</span>

<p>Then <i>Strawberries</i>, whose leaues are a good Pot-hearbe, and the
fruit the wholesommest berry: this Hearbe of all other, would be set
of the plant, and not sowne from the séed, for the oft changing and
remouing of it causeth it to grow bigger and bigger: it groweth best
vnder the shadowes of other Hearbes, but very sufficiently in beds, or
else where.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Borage_and_Buglosse">Of Borage and Buglosse.</span>

<p>Then <i>Borage</i> and <i>Buglosse</i>, both which are of one nature:
they would be sowne in small quantity, for where they take they will
runne ouer a whole Garden: the séed must be gathered when it is halfe
ripe it is so apt to shed, and when you gather it you must plucke vp
the stalkes, leaues &amp; all, and so laying them one vpon another thrée or
foure dayes, their own heat will bring the séed to ripenes.</p>

<p>Then <i>Rosemary</i>, which is an Hearbe tender and curious, yet of
singular vertue: it is soone slaine with frost or lightening: it
will grow plentifully from the séede, but much better from the slip,
it delighteth to be planted against some Wall where it may haue the
reflection of the Sunne, for to stand vnpropped of himselfe, the very
shaking of the winde will kill it.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Penyroyal">Of Penyroyal.</span>

<p>Then <i>Penyroyall</i>, which most properly is vsed to be mixt with
Puddings, made of the bloud of Beasts, &amp; Oatmeale: of it there be two
kindes, Male and Female: the Male beareth a white flower, and the
Female a purple: it must be sowne in small quantity, for it will runne
and spread ouer-much ground: it delighteth most in moyst earth.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Leekes">Of Leekes.</span>

<p>Then <i>Leekes</i>, which would haue a fertile ground, and as soone as
they be shot vp a good length you shall cut the blades to the polt,
and then remoue the heads, and set them borderwise about your other
beds: this remouing after the cutting off the blades, wil make them
grow bigger, and prosper better, as for thrusting Oyster-shels or
Tyle-shreads vnder them, to make the heads bigger, it is a toy, for if
the mould be loose and good, the Léeke will come to his perfect growth:
they may be sowne both in March, Aprill, May, and Iune, and they may be
remoued all Iuly, August, September and October.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Onions">Of Onions.</span>

<p>Then <i>Onions</i>, which differ not much from the nature of Léekes,
they loue a fertile Soyle, and would be sowne with the séeds of Sauory:
when they come vp if they grow too thicke, as is often séene, you
shall plucke vp some and spend them in the Pot and in Sallets, to giue
the rest more roome, and some you shall take vp and replant in other
beds, which you may preserue for séede: those <i>Onions</i> which you
would not haue to séede, you shall cut off the blades in the midst,
that the iuyce may descend downeward, and when you sée the heads of
the <i>Onions</i> appearing aboue the earth, you shall with your
féet tread them into the ground: there be some very well experienst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Husbands, which will take the fayrest, goodliest and soundest Onions
they can get, and in this moneth of March set them thrée fingers
déepe in the earth, and these of all other bring forth the purest and
best séede, for which purpose onely they are preserued: as soone as
your séed-Onions are knotted, you shall vnderproppe them with square
cradles, made of stickes, least the waight of the boules which carry
the séede, should breake the blades.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_gathering_Onion_seede">Of gathering Onion-seede, or the Onion.</span>

<p>The time of gathering your séede is, when it is all turned purely
blacke, and the time of gathering the Onions is, when the heads doe
forsake the earth, after they be gathered you shall lay them on a dry
floore for a fortnight, or more, and then binde them vp in ropes, and
hang them where they may haue the ayre of the fire, onely note that
shall gather your Onions in the increase of the Moone, as they were
sowne, and not otherwise.</p>

<p>Many other Pot-hearbs there be, which for as much as they differ
nothing, eyther in sowing, planting, or ordering, from these which I

it may be sowne in any barraine, stony, or grauelly Soyle, in the
months of May, Aprill, or September: it neither desireth much wéeding,
nor much watering, but being once committed to the ground appeareth
sodainely: and thus much of those Hearbes which are fit for Medicine,
of which though there be many others, yet they differ not in their
ordering from these already declared.</p>

<img class="drop-cap2" src="images/i038.png" alt="">
</div>
<p class="noindent drop-cap2">Amongst the many numbers of Sallet-Hearbes I thinke it not amisse to
beginne first with <i>Lettuce</i>, which of all other whose vertue
is helde in the leafe, is most delicate, tender, and pleasant: the
ground then in which it most delighteth, is that which is most fertile,
best laboured, and of the finest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> mould, being soft, loose, and more
enclining to moysture then drinesse: it may be sowne in any moneth of
the yeare, from February to Nouember; it is very quick of growth, and
will appeare aboue the earth in foure dayes after the sowing: it would
at first be sowne thicke, and carefully kept with morning and euening
watrings, if the season be dry, but not otherwise: after it is growne
and faire spread aboue the earth, which will be in a moneths space or
there-abouts, you shall chuse out the fairest and goodliest plants,
and taking them vp with the earth and all, about their rootes, replant
or remoue them to a new bed of fresh mould, and there set them a foote
distance one from another, and fixe their rootes fast and hard into
the ground: then couer or presse them downe with Tyle or Slate stones,
to make them spread and not spring vpward, by which meanes the leaues
will gather together, and cabbadge, in a thicke and good order, for it
is to be vnderstood, that the oftner you remoue your <i>Lettuce</i>,
the fairer and closer they wil cabbage. There be diuers which obserue
to remoue <i>Lettuce</i> as soone as sixe leaues are sprung aboue the
ground; but I like better to remoue them when they begin to spindle:
they are most estéemed in the moneths of Aprill, May, and Iune, for in
Iuly they are supposed to carrie in them a poysonous substance.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Spynage">Of Spynage.</span>

<p>Next the <i>Lettuce</i> I preferre the hearbe <i>Spynage</i>, which
delighteth in a well-dunged earth, and may be sowne in Aprill, March,
September, or October: it would not be mixed with other séedes, because
it prospereth best alone.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Sparagus">Of Sparagus.</span>

<p><i>Sparagus</i> ioyeth in a fertill moist ground, the mould being made
light which couers it, and the ground well dunged, the Spring is the
best time to sowe it, and it must be sowne in long furrowes or trenches
made with your finger, and not vniuersally spread ouer the bed as other
séeds are: it loueth moysture, but may not endure the wet to lye long
vpon it, and therefore the beds would a little descend it: must not be
remoued till the rootes be so feltred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> together, that they hinder the
new branches from springing vp, which commonly is two yeares.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Colworts">Of Colworts.</span>

<p><i>Colworts</i> or <i>Cabbadge</i> séede delighteth in any well
husbanded ground, and may be sowen in all sorts and seasons as
<i>Lettuce</i> is, and must also in the like manner be remoued, after
the principall leaues are come forth, which will make them to gather
together, and cabbadge the better: and as they may be sowen in any
season of the yeare, so likewise they may be remoued at all seasons
likewise, except the frost or other vnseasonable weather hinder you:
and although some men will not allow it to be sowen in clay grounds,
grauell, chalke, or sand, yet they are deceiued; for if the earth be
well ordred, they will grow plentifully, onely you must obserue when
you remoue them to let them haue earth roome enough.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Sage">Of Sage.</span>

<p><i>Sage</i> is in Gardens most common, because it is most wholesome,
and though it may be better set from the slip then sowen in the séede,
yet both will prosper, it loueth any well drest ground, and may be
sowen either in February, March, September, or October: it loueth also
to grow thick and close together, and will of it selfe ouercome most
wéedes: it asketh not much dung, neither too great care in watring,
onely it would be oft searched, for Toades and other venemous things
will delight to lye vnder it, the more Sunne and ayre it hath, the
better it is.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Purslane">Of Purslane.</span>

<p><i>Purslane</i> is a most excellent Sallet-hearbe, and loueth a fertile
soile, and though it may be sowen almost in any moneth, yet the warmest
is the best, as Aprill, May, Iune, or Septemb. Buck ashes are an
excellent meanure for them, and for most Sallet-hearbs else, but aboue
all they loue dry dust and house-swéepings, they are apt to shed their
séede, whence it comes that a ground once possest of them will seldome
want them, they may also be remoued, and will prosper much the better.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Artichokes">Of Artichokes.</span>

<p><i>Artychokes</i> loue a fat earth, and may be sowen in February or
March, the Moone encreasing, the séedes must not be sowen together, but
set one by one a good distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> asunder; they must lye somewhat déepe,
and be firmely couered; yet if you can procure them, I rather wish you
rather to set them from Slips or young Plants, then sowe them from the
séedes, for they doe so naturally loue the earth, that you can hardly
slip so wast a leafe from an <i>Artychoke</i> as will not take roote;
if you sowe the séede, you must be carefull to wéede and water them
well, for the first leaues are very tender: also if you remoue them
after their first springing, the fruit will be bigger and better.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Garlicke">Of Garlicke.</span>

<p><i>Garlicke</i> is best in September and Nouember, to be set from the
cloue, in &amp; about the borders of beds, or other séedes, halfe a foote
one from another, and in February, March, and Aprill, to be sowen from
the séede: it must be ordered as you order <i>Onyon</i> séede, it loues
not much wet nor extreame drought, onely it desires a good mould which
is rich and firme, yet not too much dunged.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Raddish">Of Raddish.</span>

<p><i>Raddish</i> loueth a fertile ground, that is well dunged, chiefly
with mans ordure, that is déepe trencht, and hath an easie and light
mould, and the séedes would be placed either in rowes, or about the
borders of beds, as you doe <i>Garlicke</i>: the manner of sowing it is
with a dibble or round sticke, to make a hole into the ground almost
a foote déepe, and then into that hole to put not aboue two séedes at
the most, and then close the hole vp againe, and let the holes be foure
fingers one from another, it may be sowen in most months of the yéere
if the frost hinder not, and to make the roote large &amp; tender, and to
kéepe the branch from séeding; you shall as it springs crop off the
principall leaues which grow against the heart of the root: to tread
them downe into the earth after they haue fast roote is good also.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Nauew">Of Nauew.</span>

<p><i>Nauew</i>, if the earth haue any small goodnesse in it will grow
plentifully, neither is offended with any ayre, onely the mould would
be loose and rough, for otherwise it many times turneth to Rape: the
séede naturally commeth vp very thicke, therefore it is expedient to
remoue them and plant them thinner, for that best preserueth their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
natures, they may be sowne in February, March, Aprill, September, or
October.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Parsneps_and_Carrets">Of Parsneps and Carrets.</span>

<p><i>Parsneps</i> or <i>Carrets</i> are of one and the selfe nature, they
delight in a good fat earth, and would be sowne reasonably thicke, in
long déepe trenches like furrowes, hauing a gentle and easie mould
either in the moneth of Ianuary, February, or March, or in September,
October, or December, they must be carefully well wéeded, and if the
earth be fat, they néede not much watring or other attendance.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Pompyons">Of Pompyons.</span>

<p><i>Pompyons</i>, <i>Gourds</i>, or <i>Mellons</i>, desire a very good
ground, or by Nature or Art, the séedes must be sowne very thinne, as
at least halfe a foote one from another, they would lye reasonably
déepe, yet the mould very gentle which couers them, they are subiect
to spread and runne ouer much ground, therefore as they grow you must
direct their stemmes so as they may not annoy one another, and when
they flower you shall lay broad Tiles or Slate stones vnder them,
that the fruit nor flower may not touch the earth; if you plash them
vp against trées or walles where they may haue the reflection of the
Sunne, the fruit will be larger, pleasanter, and sooner ripe: they
néede no wéeding nor watring after you sée them appeare aboue the
earth, and the best seasons to sowe them in, is February, March, or
Aprill, those are the best <i>Pompyons</i> which haue the smallest
séedes, and are of the most yellowest complexion.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Cowcumber">Of the Cowcumber.</span>

<p><i>Cowcumber</i>, is a delicate, pleasant, yet very tender fruit,
and delighteth in an extraordinarie fat earth, especially during
the opening or sprouting of the séede, therefore the best and most
vndoubted safest way for sowing them is, first in some corner of your
Kitchin garden to make a bed of two or thrée yards square of olde Oxe
dung, and Horse dung mixt together, and at least a yard or better high
from the earth, then couer this bed of dung with the richest garden
mould you haue, better then halfe a foote thicke: then thereon place
your séedes halfe a foote likewise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> one from another, and be most
sure that your séedes be hard and sound (for any softnesse in them
sheweth rottennesse) then couer them foure fingers thicke with the
like mould: then within seauen or eight dayes, after you shall sée
them appeare aboue the earth, but in any wise let them continue still
till the principall leaues be come forth, and they begin to créepe out
in length, then with your hand griping the whole plant, take it vp by
the rootes with the earth and all, and plant it in a bed new digged &amp;
trimmed for the purpose with a rich loose mould, and so replant and
remoue each roote seuerally one after another, and they will grow and
bring forth in great plenty. Now by the way you must obserue, that as
soone as you haue sowne your séedes you shall prouide a Mat, Canuasse,
or other couering, which being placed vpon stakes ouer the dung bed,
shall euery night after Sunne-set be spread ouer the same, and not
taken away till the Sunne be risen in the morning, for this will defend
the séedes from frosts and other cold dewes which are very dangerous.
Now if any demand why these séedes are thus sowne first on the bed
of dung, they shall vnderstand that besides the warmth and fertility
thereof, that the séedes are so pleasant and tender, that wormes and
other créeping things in the earth will destroy them before they can
sprout, which this bed of dung preuenteth. The months most fit for
sowing these séedes, are Aprill, May and Iune onely, for other are much
too colde, and in this manner you may sowe any tender séede whatsoeuer.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Beane_of_Egipt">Of the Beane of Egipt.</span>

<p><i>Beanes</i> of <i>Egipt</i> delight in a moyst watrish ground, rather
fertile then any way giuen to barrainnesse, yet will plentifully enough
prosper in any indifferent earth: they are rather to set then sowe,
because they must take strong roote, and be fixed somewhat déepe into
the earth, and the moneth which is most proper for them, is the latter
end of Ianuary, all February and the beginning of March onely.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Skerrets">Of Skerrets.</span>

<p><i>Skerrets</i> are a delicate roote, white, tender, and pleasant,
little differing in tast or excellencie from the <i>Eringo</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> They
delight in a rich mould, moyst and well broken, and must be set déepe
in the earth: after they be a finger length aboue the ground they
would be remoued, and planted in a fresh mould, which will preserue
them from spéedie séeding, for when they runne to séede, they loose
the vertue of their roote. The moneths fittest for the sowing of them
is March, Aprill, and May, and if you desire to haue them all Winter,
you may then sowe them in September and October. And thus much for
Sallet-hearbs, and rootes of all natures, of which kindes though there
be diuers other, yet you shall vnderstand, all are to be ordered in the
manner of these before rehearsed, that is to say, such as haue their
vertues in the stalke or leaues, like <i>Spynage</i>, <i>Sparagus</i>,
<i>Purslayn</i>, and such like, those which cabbadge or knit together
in hard lumps, like <i>Lettuce</i>, <i>Colworts</i>, and such like,
and those whose goodnesse liues in their rootes, like <i>Raddish</i>,
<i>Carrets</i>, <i>Skerrets</i>, and such like.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="A_most_necessary_obseruation">A most necessary obseruation.</span>

<p>Now for a most necessarie obseruation, euery Gardner ought to beare
this rule in his memorie, that all Pot-hearbs must be sowne thicke, and
but thinly couered, as namely not aboue thrée fingers: all hearbs which
cabbadge must be sowne thicke, and déeper couered, as a full handfull
at least, and in their remouing planted thinne, and well fixt into
the earth: and all rootes must be sowen thinne and déepe, as almost a
foote either let into the ground, or strewed in déepe furrowes, digged
and laide vp for the purpose, in which the quantity of your séede must
onely direct you: for if you haue occasion to sow hardly a handfull,
then you may set them one by one into the ground at your leasure, but
if you haue occasion to sowe many Pecks or halfe Pecks, then you shall
turne vp your earth into déepe furrowes, and in the bottome thereof
scatter your séeds, and after rake it into a leuell, and you shall not
onely saue much labour, but gaine your purpose.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent drop-cap2">Hauing written sufficiently of Pot-hearbs and Sallet-hearbs, which
are the ornaments of the Husbandmans Kitchin or Table, I will here
speake of flowers, which either for their smels, beauties, or both,
are the graces of his Chamber. And first, because my maine ayme and
scope is English Husbandrie, I will begin with those flowers which are
most proper and naturall for our climate, of which because I holde
<i>Roses</i> both for their smell, beauties, and wholesomnesse to
excéede all other, I thinke it not amisse to giue them the first place
and precedencie before all other.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Roses">Of Roses.</span>

<p>You shall vnderstand then that <i>Roses</i> are generally and
aunciently but of thrée kindes, the Damaske, the red, and the white,
and what are different from these are but deriuations from them, being
by grafting, replanting, and phisicking, somewhat altered either in
colour, smell, or doublenesse of leafe.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Damaske_Rose">Of the Damaske Rose.</span>

<p>To speake then first of the Damaske <i>Rose</i>, it is fit that all
husbandmen know, that <i>Roses</i> may as well be sowne from the
séede, as planted from the roote, Syen, or branch onely, they are
the slower in comming vp, more tender to nourish, and much longer in
yéelding forth their flowers, yet for satisfaction sake and where
necessitie vrgeth, if of force or pleasure you must sowe it from the
séede, you shall chuse a ruffish earth loose and well dunged, and
you shall cast vp your beds high and narrow: the moneth which is fit
for their sowing is September, and they must be couered not aboue
four fingers déepe, they must be defended well all the Winter from
frosts and stormes, and then they will beare their flowers plentifully
all the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> Spring following: yet this is to be noted, that all
<i>Roses</i> which rise from the séede simply, their flowers will be
single like the <i>Eglantine</i>, or <i>Cyphanie</i>, therefore after
your plants are two yéeres olde, you must graft one into another, as
you doe other fruit, and that will make them double and thicke: also
you must remember that those yellow small séedes which are in the
midst of the <i>Rose</i>, are not true <i>Rose</i> séedes, but those
which lye hid in the round peare knob vnder the <i>Rose</i>, which as
soone as the leaues are fallen away, will open and shew the séede.
And thus much touching the sowing of all sorts of <i>Roses</i>, which
is for experience and knowledge sake onely, for indéede the true vse
and property of the <i>Rose</i> is to be planted in short slips about
fourtéene inches long, and the small tassels of the roote cut away,
they would be set halfe a foote into the ground, in the same manner as
you set ordinary Quick-set, and of like thicknesse, rather a little
slope-wise then vpright: and though some thinke March the best season,
yet doubtlesse September is much better for hauing the roote confirmed
all the Winter, they will beare the sooner and better all the Sommer
following; you must be carefull to plant them in faire weather, and
as néere as you can vnder shelter as by the sides of walls, and such
like couert where the Sunne may reflect against them, and if they be
planted on open beds or borders, then you must with Poales and other
necessaries support them and hold them vp, least the winde shake their
rootes and hinder their growing.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_red_Rose">Of the red Rose.</span>

<p>The red <i>Rose</i> is not fully so tender as the Damaske, neither
is it so pleasant in smell, nor doubleth his leaues so often; yet it
is much more Phisicall, and oftner vsed in medicine, it is likewise
fitter to be planted then sowen, and the earth in which it most ioyeth
would be a little rough or grauelly, and the best compasse you can lay
vnto it, is rubbish or the sweeping of houses, the moneths to sowe or
plant it in is March or September, &amp; the time to prune and cut away the
superfluous branches is euer the midst of October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_white_Rose">Of the white Rose.</span>

<p>The white <i>Rose</i> is of lesse smell then the red, and will grow in
a harder ground, his vse is altogether in Phisicke as for sore eyes and
such like: it will grow into a Trée of some bigge substance, and is
seldome hurt with frosts, stormes, or blastings: it would likewise be
planted from the roote against some high wall, either in the moneth of
February or March, and the oftner you plant and replant it, the doubler
and larger the flower will be: for the earth it much skilleth not,
because it will grow almost in euery ground, onely it delights most in
the shadow, and would be seldome pruned, except you finde many dead
branches.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Cinamon_Rose">Of the Cinamon Rose.</span>

<p>The <i>Cinamon Rose</i>, is for the most part sowen, and not planted,
whence it comes that you shall euer sée the leaues single and little,
the delicacie thereof being onely in the smell, which that you may
haue most fragrant and strong, you shall take a vessell of earth,
being full of small holes in the bottome and sides, and fill it with
the richest earth you can get, being made fine and loose, then take
Damaske <i>Rose</i> séedes which are hard, and sound, and stéepe them
foure and twenty houres in <i>Cinamon</i> water, I doe not meane the
distilled water, but faire Conduit water, in which good store of
<i>Cinamon</i> hath bin stéeped, or boyled, or milk, wherin good store
of <i>Cinamon</i> hath bin dissolued, and then sow those séedes into
the Pot, and couer them almost thrée fingers déepe, then morning and
euening till they appeare aboue the earth, water them with that water
or milke in which the seedes were stéeped, then when they are sprung vp
a handfull or more aboue the ground, you shall take them vp mould and
all, and hauing drest a border or bed for the purpose, plant them so as
they may grow vp against some warme wall or pale, and haue the Sunne
most part of the day shining vpon them, and you shall be sure to haue
<i>Roses</i> growing on them, whose smell will be wonderfull pleasant,
as if they had béene spiced with <i>Cinamon</i>, and the best season of
sowing these is euer in March, at high noone day, the weather shining
faire, and the winde most calme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_make_the_Cinamon_Rose">To make the Cinamon Rose grow double.</span>

<p>Now if you would haue these <i>Roses</i> to grow double, which is an
Art yet hid from most Gardners, you shall at Michaelmasse take the
vppermost parts of the Plante from the first knot, and as you graft
either Plumme or Apple, so graft one into another, and couer the heads
with earth or clay tempered with <i>Cinamon</i>-water, and they will
not onely grow double, but the smell will be much swéeter, and looke
how oft you will graft and re-graft them, so much more double and
double they will proue.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Prouince_Rose">Of the Prouince Rose.</span>

<p>The <i>Prouince Rose</i> is a delicate flower for the eye more then the
nose, for his oft grafting abateth his smell, but doubleth his leafe so
oft that it is wonderfull, therefore if you will haue them large and
faire, you shall take the fairest Damaske <i>Roses</i> you can get,
and graft them into the red <i>Rose</i>, and when they haue shot out
many branches, then you shall graft each seuerall branch againe with
new grafts of another grafted Damaske <i>Rose</i>: and thus by grafting
graft vpon graft, you shall haue as faire and well coloured <i>Prouince
Roses</i>, as you can wish or desire: and thus you may doe either in
the Spring or fall at your pleasure, but the fall of the leafe is euer
helde the best season.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_make_Roses_smell_well">To make Roses smell well.</span>

<p>Now if your <i>Roses</i> chaunce to loose their smels, as it oft
happeneth through these double graftings: you shall then plant
<i>Garlicke</i> heads at the rootes of your <i>Roses</i>, and that
will bring the pleasantnesse of their sent vnto them againe.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Generall_notes_touching_Roses">Generall notes touching Roses.</span>

<p>Now for your generall obseruations; you shall remember that it is good
to water your <i>Roses</i> morning and euening till they be gathered;
you shall rather couet to plant your <i>Roses</i> in a dry ground then
a wette, you shall giue them much shelter, strong support, and fresh
dung twise at the least euery yeare, when the leafe is fallen, you
shall cutte and prune the branches, and when the buds appeare you, then
begin your first watring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Lauender">Of Lauender.</span>

<p><i>Lauender</i> is a flower of a hot smell, and is more estéemed of the
plaine Country housewife then the dainty Citizen: it is very wholesome
amongst linnen cloathes, and would be sowen in a good rich mould, in
the moneths of March or Aprill.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_white_Lilly">Of the white Lilly.</span>

<p>The white <i>Lilly</i> would be sowen in a fat earth, in the moneths
of October and Nouember, or in March or April, and the séedes must be
sowen excéeding thinne, not one by any meanes touching another, and the
mould which couereth them must be sifted gently vpon them.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_make_Lillyes_of_any_colour">To make Lillyes of any colour.</span>

<p>If you would haue your <i>Lillyes</i> of a purple colour, you shall
stéepe your séedes in the Lées of red wine, and that will change
their complexion, and also you shall water the Plants with the same
Lées likewise: if you will haue them scarlet red, you shall put
<i>Vermillion</i> or <i>Cynaber</i> betwéene the rinde and the small
heads growing about the roote: if you would haue them blew, you shall
dissolue <i>Azure</i> or <i>Byse</i> betwéene the rinde and the heads,
if yellow <i>Orpment</i>, if gréene <i>Verdigreace</i>, and thus of any
other colour.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_make_Lillyes_flourish">To make Lillyes flourish all the yeere.</span>

<p>Now to make them flourish euery moneth in the yéere, you shall sowe
your séedes some a foote déepe, some halfe a foote, and some not two
inches, so they will spring one after another, and flourish one after
another.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_wood_Lilly">Of the wood Lilly.</span>

<p>The wood <i>Lilly</i> or <i>Lilly</i> of the vale, delighteth most in
a moyst ground, and may be sowen either in March or September, it is
very faire to looke on, and not so suffocating in smell as the other
<i>Lillyes</i> are.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_flower_de_Lice">Of the flower de Lice.</span>

<p>The <i>flower de Lice</i> is of excellent beauty, but not very pleasant
to smell to, it loueth a dry ground &amp; an easie mould, and is fittest to
be sowen in the moneth of March.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Pyonie">Of Pyonie.</span>

<p><i>Pyonie</i> or the blessed <i>Rose</i>, loueth a good fat earth
being somewhat loose, and may be sowen either in March or September,
it asketh not much watring, onely some support because the stalkes be
weake.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Petillius">Of Petillius.</span>

<p><i>Petillius</i> or <i>Indian eye</i>, may be sowen in any ground, for
it desireth neither much water, nor much dung, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> the best season for
sowing, it is Iune or September, for it will beare flowers commonly all
the Winter.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Veluet_flower">Of Veluet flower.</span>

<p><i>Veluet flower</i> loueth a rich fertile ground, and must be much
watred: the season best for the sowing is August, for commonly it will
beare flowers all the Winter.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Gylliflowers">Of Gylliflowers.</span>


<p><i>Gilliflowers</i> are of diuers kindes, as <i>Pynks</i>,
<i>Wall-flowers</i>, <i>Carnations</i>, <i>Cloue Gilliflowers</i>,
and a world of others, which are of all other flowers most swéet and
delicate: all but the <i>Wall-gilliflower</i> loue good fertile earths,
and may be sowen either in March, Iuly, or August. They are better to
be planted of Slips then sowen, yet both will prosper. They are very
tender, and therfore the best planting of them is in earthen Pots, or
halfe Tubs, which at your pleasure you may remoue from the shade to the
Sunne, and from the roughnesse of stormes to places of shelter, they
grow vp high on long slender stalkes, which you must defend and support
with square cradles made of stickes, least the winde and the waight
of the flowers breake them: these <i>Gilliflowers</i> you may make of
any colour you please, in such sort as is shewed you for the colouring
of <i>Lillyes</i>, <span class="sidenote" id="Of_grafting_of_Gylliflowers">Of grafting of Gylliflowers.</span>
and if you please to haue them of mixt colours
you may also, by grafting of contrary colours one into another: and
you may with as great ease graft the <i>Gylliflower</i> as any fruit
whatsoeuer, by the ioyning of the knots one into another, and then
wrapping them about with a little soft sleau’d silke, and couering the
place close with soft red Waxe well tempered. And you shall vnderstand
that the grafting of <i>Gylliflowers</i> maketh them excéeding great,
double, and most orient of colour.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_smels_of_Gylliflowers">Of the smels of Gylliflowers.</span>

<p>Now if you will haue your <i>Gylliflowers</i> of diuers smels or
odours, you may also with great ease, as thus for example: if you will
take two or thrée great cloues, &amp; stéepe them foure and twenty houres
in Damaske <i>Rose</i> water, then take them out and bruise them, and
put them into a fine Cambricke ragge, and so binde them about the heart
roote of the <i>Gylliflower</i>, néere to the setting on of the stalke,
and so plant it in a fine, soft, and fertile mould, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> flower
which springeth from the same, will haue so delicate a mixt smell of
the Cloue and the Rose-water, that it will bréede both delight and
wonder. If in the same manner you take a sticke of <i>Cinamon</i>,
and stéepe it in <i>Rose</i> water, and then bruise it, and binde it
as afore-said, all the flowers will smell strongly of <i>Cinamon</i>:
if you take two graines of fat Muske, and mixe it with two drops of
Damaske <i>Rose</i> water, and binde it as afore-said, the flowers will
smell strongly of Muske, yet not too hot nor offensiue, by reason of
the correction of the <i>Rose</i> water: and in this sort you may doe
either with <i>Amber-greece</i>, <i>Storax</i>, <i>Beniamin</i>, or
any other swéet drugge whatsoeuer; and if in any of these confections
before named, you stéepe the séedes of your <i>Gylliflowers</i> foure
and twenty houres before you sowe them, they will take the same smels
in which you stéepe them, onely they will not be so large or double, as
those which are replanted or grafted.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Wall_Gylliflower">Of the Wall Gylliflower.</span>

<p>Now for your <i>Wall Gylliflower</i>, it delighteth in hard rubbish,
limy, and stonie grounds, whence it commeth that they couet most to
grow vpon walles, pauements, and such like barraine places. It may be
sowen in any moneth or season, for it is a séede of that hardnesse,
that it makes no difference betwixt Winter and Sommer, but will
flourish in both equally, and beareth his flowers all the yéere, whence
it comes that the Husbandman preserues it most in his Bée-garden; for
it is wondrous swéet, and affordeth much honey. It would be sowen
in very small quantity, for after it haue once taken roote, it will
naturally of it selfe ouer-spread much ground, and hardly euer after be
rooted out. It is of it selfe of so exéeding a strong and swéet smell,
that it cannot be forced to take any other, and therefore is euer
preserued in its owne nature.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Helytropian">Of the Helytropian.</span>

<p>The <i>Helytropian</i> or flower of the Sunne, is in nature and colour
like our English <i>Marigold</i>, onely it is excéeding huge in
compasse, for many of them will be twenty, and foure and twenty inches
in compasse, according to the fertilenesse of the soyle in which they
grow, and the oft replanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> of their rootes, they are excéeding
goodly to looke on, and pleasant to smell, they open their flowers at
the rising of the Sunne, and close them againe at the Sunne setting,
it delighteth in any soyle which is fertile either by Art or Nature,
and may be sowen in any moneth from February till September, the oft
planting and replanting of the roote after it is sprung a handfull
from the earth, maketh it grow to the vttermost bignesse, it would haue
the East and West open vpon it, onely some small Pent-house to kéepe
the sharpnesse of the winde from it.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Crowne_Emperiall">Of the Crowne Emperiall.</span>

<p>The <i>Crowne-Emperiall</i>, is of all flowers both forraigne and
home-bred, the delicatest and strangest: it hath the true shape of an
Emperiall Crowne, and will be of diuers colours, according to the Art
of the Gardner. In the middest of the flower you shall sée a round
Pearle stand, in proportion, colour, and orientnesse, like a true
naturall Pearle, onely it is of a soft liquid substance: This Pearle if
you shake the flower neuer so violently will not fall off, neither if
you let it continue neuer so long, will it either encrease or diminish
in the bignesse, but remayneth all one: yet if with your finger you
take and wipe it away, in lesse then an houre after you shall haue
another arise in the same place, and of the same bignesse. This Pearle
if you taste it vpon your tongue, is pleasant and swéet like honey:
this flower when the Sunne ariseth, you shall sée it looke directly
to the East, with the stalke bent lowe there-vnto, and as the Sunne
ariseth higher and higher, so the flower will likewise ascend, and
when the Sunne is come into the <i>Meridian</i> or noone poynt, which
is directly ouer it, then will it stand vpright vpon the stalke, and
looke directly vpward, and as the Sunne declineth, so will it likewise
decline, and at the Sunne setting looke directly to the West onely. The
séedes of this flower are very tender, and therefore would be carefully
sowen in a very rich and fertile earth well broken and manured. The
seasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> most méete for the same, is the latter end of March, Aprill,
or May, for the flowers flourish most in May, Iune, and Iuly. As soone
as it is sprung a handfull aboue the earth; you shall remoue it into a
fresh mould, and that will make it flourish the brauer: the roote of
this flower is like an Apple, or great flat Onion, and therefore in the
replanting of it, you must be carefull to make a hole large and fitte
for the same, and to fixe the mould gently and close about the same.
In the Winter it shrinketh into the earth, and is hardly or not at all
discerned, by meanes whereof I haue séene diuers supposing it to be
dead, to digge vp the earth, and negligently spoyle the roote, but be
not you of that opinion, and in the Spring you shall sée it arise and
flourish brauely.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Dulippo">Of the Dulippo.</span>

<p>The <i>Dulippo</i> is but a little short of the <i>Crowne Emperiall</i>
in pleasantnesse and rarenesse, for you may haue them of all colours
whatsoeuer, in such sort as was shewed you for the <i>Lillyes</i>,
<i>Gylliflowers</i>, and other rootes: they are tender at their first
springing from the séede, and therefore must be sowen in a fine rich
mould, in the warmth of the Sunne, either in March, Aprill, or May:
but after they are once sprung aboue the ground, they are reasonable
hard, and will defend themselues against most weathers: the roote of
this flower is shaped like a Peare, with the biggest end downeward, and
many small thréeds at the bottome; therefore you must be sure when you
remoue or replant it, to couer all the roote in fresh mould, and let
not any part of the white thereof be vncouered: this flower by monethly
replanting, you may haue to flourish in all the Summer moneths of the
yeare, for in the dead of Winter it shrinketh into the ground, and is
hardly or not at all perceiued, the stalkes of these flowers are weake,
therefore to support them, and defend them from the shakings of the
windes with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> little square frames of stickes, will be very good and
necessary, it must be oft watred.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Hyacinth">Of the Hyacinth.</span>

<p>The <i>Hyacinth</i> is a flower more delicate to the eye then nose,
and is of a good strong nature, for it will endure any reasonable
earth, and may be sowne in any moneth of the Spring, from the beginning
of February till midde-Iune: it onely hateth tempests and stormes,
and therefore is commonly sowen or planted néere vnto walls or other
shelter. You may haue them of any colour you please, as is shewed
before of other flowers, and in this alteration or mixture of colours
their greatest glorie appeareth, they will flourish all the Summer
long, and if they stand warme, appeare very early in the Spring.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Narcissus">Of the Narcissus.</span>

<p>The <i>Narcissus</i> is a very curious and dainty flower, and through
his much variety and alteration in growing, they are supposed to be of
diuers kindes, but it is not so, for in as much as they are séene to
be of diuers colours, that is but the Art of the Gardner, as is before
exprest in other flowers, and whereas some of them grow single, some
double, and some double vpon double, you shall vnderstand that such as
grow single, grow simply from the séede onely, those which are double
and no more, are such as haue béene planted and replanted, the small
thréeds of the rootes being clipt away, and nothing left about it that
is superfluous, and those which are double vpon double, are the double
plants grafted one into another. This <i>Narcissus</i> loueth a rich
warme soyle, the mould being easie and light, it may be sowne in any
moneth of the Spring, and will flourish all the Summer after. Before it
appeare aboue ground it would be oft watred, but after it skils not how
little, for it will defend it selfe sufficiently.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_Daffadill_Colombin_and_Chesbole">Of the Daffadill, Colombine, and Chesbole.</span>


<p>Not vnlike vnto this is your <i>Daffadill</i> of all kindes and
colours, and in the same earths and seasons delighteth either to be
sowen or planted, and will in the same manner as your <i>Narcissus</i>
double and redouble his leaues; so will your <i>Colombine</i>, your
<i>Chesbole</i>, and almost any hollow flower whatsoeuer. Many other
forraigne flowers there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> are which grow plentifully in our Kingdome:
but the order of their planting and sowing differeth nothing from these
which I haue already declared, being the most tender and curious of all
other, <span class="sidenote" id="An_excellent_Caution">An excellent Caution.</span>
therefore I will end this Chapter with this one <i>caution</i>
onely, that when you shall receiue any séede from any forraine
Nation, you shall learne as néere as you can the nature of the soyle
from whence it commeth, as hot, moyst, colde, or dry it is, and then
comparing it with ours, sowe it as néere as you can in the earth, and
in the seasons that are néerest to the soyle from whence it came, as
thus for example: if it came from a clime much hotter then ours, then
shall you sowe it in sandie mould or other mould made warme by strength
of meanure, in the warmest time of the day, and in those moneths of the
Spring, which are warmest, as Aprill or May, you shall let it haue the
Sunne fréely all the day and at night, with Mats, Penthouse, or other
defence shield it from sharpe windes, frosts, or colde dewes.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="A_new_manner_of_planting_flowers">A new manner of planting flowers and fruits.</span>

<p>I haue séene diuers Noblemen and Gentlemen, which haue béene very
curious in these dainty flowers, which haue made large frames of wood
with boards of twenty inches déepe, standing vpon little round whéeles
of wood, which being made square or round according to the Masters
fancie, they haue filled with choyse earth, such as is most proper to
the flower they would haue grow, and then in them sowe their séedes,
or fixe their Plants in such sort, as hath béene before described,
and so placing them in such open places of the Garden, where they may
haue the strength and violence of the Sunnes heate all the day, and
the comfort of such moderate showers, as fall without violence or
extraordinarie beating, and at night draw them by mans strength into
some low vaulted gallery ioyning vpon the Garden, where they may stand
warme and safe from stormes, windes, frosts, dewes, blastings, and
other mischiefes which euer happen in the Sunnes absence, and in this
manner you may not onely haue all manner of dainty outlandish flowers,
but also all sorts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span> the most delicatest fruits that may be, as the
<i>Orenge</i>, <i>Limond</i>, <i>Pomgranate</i>, <i>Poncythron</i>,
<i>Cynamon-tree</i>, <i>Oliue</i>, <i>Almond</i>, or any other, from
what clime so euer it be deriued, obseruing onely but to make your
frames of wood, which containes your earth, but déeper and larger,
according to the fruit you plant in it, and that your Alleys through
which you draw your Trées when you house them be smooth and leuell,
least being rough and vneuen, you iogge and shake the rootes with the
waight of the Trées, which is dangerous. And least any man may imagine
this but an imaginary supposition, I can assure him that within seauen
miles of London, the experiment is to be séene, where all these fruits
and flowers with a world of others grow in two Gardens most abundantly.
Now for such flowers or fruits as shall be brought from a colder or
more barraine ground then our owne, there néedeth not much curiosity
in the plantation of them, because a better euer bringeth forth a
better encrease, onely I would wish you to obserue, to giue all such
fruits or flowers the vttermost liberty of the weather, &amp; rather to
adde coolenes by shaddow, then encrease any warmth by reflection, as
also to augment showers by artificiall watrings, rather then to let
the roote dry for want of continuall moysture; many other notes and
obseruations there are, which to discouer, would aske a volume larger
then I intend, and yet not be more in true substance, then this which
is already writ, if the Reader haue but so much mother-wit, as by
comparing things together, to draw the vses from the true reasons, and
to shunne contrary by contraries, which what Husbandman is so simple,
but he can easily performe, and hauing the true grounds of experience,
frame his descant according to his owne fancie, which is a Musicke best
pleasing to all men, since it is not in any one mans power to giue a
generall contentment. And thus much for flowers, and their generall and
particular ordering.</p>

<p class="noindent drop-cap2">It is not enough to bequeath and giue your séedes vnto the
ground, and then immediatly to expect (without any further industrie)
the fruit of your labours, no goodnesse seldome commeth with such ease:
you must therefore know that when you lay your séedes in the ground,
they are like so many good men amongst a world of wicked ones, and
as it were inuironed and begirt with maine Armies of enemies, from
which if your care and diligence doe not defend them the most, if not
all, will doubtlesse perish, and of these enemies the worst and most
violentest is <i>Thunder</i> and <i>Lightning</i>, which in a moment
killeth all sorts of flowers, plants, and trées, euen in the height
and pride of their flourishing, which to preuent, it hath béene the
practise of all the auncient Gardners, to plant against the walles
of their Gardens, or in the middest of their quarters, where their
choysest flowers grow, the <i>Lawrell</i> or <i>Bay</i> Trée, which is
euer helde a defence against those strikings.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Caterpillers">Of Caterpillers.</span>

<p>Next vnto <i>Thunder</i> and <i>Lightning</i> are <i>Caterpillers</i>,
which are a kinde of filthy little wormes, which lye in Cobwebs about
the leaues, deuouring them, and poysoning the sap, in such sort, that
the Plant dieth spéedily after: the way to kill these, is to take
strong Vrine and Ashes mixt together, and with it to dash and sprinkle
all the Plants cleane ouer, and it will both preuent their bréeding, or
being bred will kill them: the smoake of Brimstone will doe the like,
yet if they be excéeding much abundant, the surest way to destroy them,
is to take olde, rotten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span> mouldy Hay, and setting it on fire, with the
blaze thereof burne the Cob-webs, and then with the smoake smother and
kill the wormes, and they will hardly euer bréede in that place againe.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Toades_and_Frogges">Of Toades and Frogges.</span>

<p>Next these are <i>Toades</i> and <i>Frogges</i>, which are very
poysonous and great destroyers of young Plants, chiefly in their
first appearing aboue the ground, and the auncient Gardners haue vsed
to destroy them by burning the fat of a Stagge in some part of the
Garden beds, from which earth all creatures that haue poyson in them,
will flye with all violence: other Gardners will watch where the Kite
pearcheth on nights, and gathering vp her dung, scatter it vpon the
beds either simply, or mixt with the shauings of an olde Harts horne,
and no venemous thing will come néere it.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_field_Myce">Of the field Myce.</span>

<p>Next these are field <i>Myce</i>, which will roote séedes out of the
earth, and deuoure them aboundantly, which to kill you shall take
<i>Henbane seede</i>, and beate it to pouder, and then mixing it with
swéete Oyle, fresh Butter, or Grease, make thereof a bayte; and when
you finde where they scratch or roote, lay some part of the bayte in
that place, and they will gréedily eate it, and it will kill them:
there be other Gardners which will take a Wéesell, and burning it to
ashes, scatter the ashes on the beds, and then no field <i>Mouse</i>
will come néere them.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Flyes">Of Flyes.</span>

<p>Next these are <i>Flyes</i>, as flesh-<i>Flyes</i>, <i>Scarabs</i>,
<i>Hornets</i>, <i>Dores</i>, and such like, which are great destroyers
of Séeds and Plants, when they appeare in their first leafe, and are
soft and tender, which to destroy, you shall either take <i>Orpment</i>
mixt with milke, or the pouder of <i>Allome</i>, or the ashes of any
of these <i>Flyes</i> burnt, and with it sprinkle your beds and young
plants all ouer, and it will kéepe <i>Flyes</i> that they will not dare
to come néere them.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_greene_Fly">Of the greene Fly.</span>

<p>If the gréene <i>Fly</i>, which of all other <i>Flyes</i> is most
gréedie to hurt Séedes and Plants, doe offend your Garden, you shall
take <i>Henbane</i> leaues, <i>Houseleeke</i>, and <i>Minte</i>, and
beat them in a Morter, then straine forth the iuyce,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> and then adde
thereto as much Vinegar as was of all the rest, and there-with sprinkle
your beds all ouer, and the gréene <i>Fly</i> will neuer come néere
them. Some hold opinion, that if you plant the hearbe <i>Rocket</i>
in your Garden, that it is a safe preseruatiue against these gréene
<i>Flyes</i>, for it is most certaine that the very smell thereof will
kill these, and most sorts of all other <i>Flyes</i> whatsoeuer, as
hath béene found by approued experience, and the sylts of olde auncient
Abby Gardens, which a man shall seldome finde without this hearbe
planted in them.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Gnats">Of Gnats.</span>

<p>Next these are <i>Gnats</i>, which although it be the smallest of all
Flyes, yet it is the greatest, quickest, and sharpest deuourer of
tender Plants of all other, for it biteth déeper and more venemously
sharpe, then those which are of much bigger substance: the best way
to destroy them is morning and euening, to smoake and perfume your
beds either with wet Rosemary, or with mouldy Hay: some vse to burne
<i>Calamint</i>, and some Oxe dung, and sure all are very good, for the
smoakes are very sharpe, and styflle as soone as it is receiued.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Pismyers">Of Pismyers.</span>

<p>Next these are <i>Pismyers</i>, which also are very noysome vnto
Gardens, for they will digge vp, and carrie away the smaller séedes
to their hills, and in short space spoyle and deface a bed of his
encrease, and the best way to destroy them, is, if you finde their
hill, to poure hot scalding water vpon them: or if vpon your Garden
beds you strowe Ashes or Lyme, but especially that which is made of
chalk, they will by no meanes come néere them, as you shall finde by
experience.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Moales">Of Moales.</span>

<p>Next these are <i>Moales</i>, which digging and vndermining the earth,
turneth vp Séedes and Plants in a confused fashion, to the vtter
destruction and ruine of the Husband-mans labour, the cure whereof is
to take them in such sort, as shall be shewed in this Booke, where I
speake of Pasture grounds; but if you finde that their encrease and
continuance multiply with your labour, it shall be then good for you
to plant in diuers places of your Garden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span> the hearbe called <i>Palma
christi</i>, in other places <i>Garlickes</i> and in other places
<i>Onyons</i>, and it is an assured rule that no <i>Moale</i> will come
néere where they grow for the strength and violence of their smell, is
poysonous and deadly to those blind vermines.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Snailes">Of Snailes.</span>

<p>Next there are <i>Snailes</i> of both kindes, blacke and white, which
are as much offensiue to Gardens, as any other crawling thing, for they
féed of the tender leaues of plants, and of the outmost rindes of the
daintiest hearbs or flowers, the way to destroy them, is to sprinkle
vpon the beds and other places of their aboad good store of chimney
soote, which by no meanes they can endure, because it is mortall and
poysonous.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Moathes">Of Moathes.</span>

<p>Next there are <i>Moathes</i> or <i>Moaghts</i>, which are very
pernitious in a Garden, for they destroy both Séeds and Plants, and
there is not better or more certaine way to kill them, then by taking
olde horse hoofes, and burning them, with the smoake thereof to perfume
all the places where they abide, and it will in an instant kill
them; with this smoake onely you may kéepe Arras hanging, Tapistrie,
Néedle-worke, Cushions, or Carpets, or any woollen cloath or garment
whatsoeuer safe from <i>Moathes</i> as long as you please, neither
néede you to vse it aboue once or twice a yéere at the most, as shall
be more at large in another place declared.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Cankers">Of Cankers.</span>

<p>Next these are <i>Cankers</i>, which are a kinde of filthie wormes,
which deuoure both the great and small leaues of all sorts of swéet
Plants, especially <i>Lettuce</i>, <i>Cabbadge</i>, <i>Colaflours,</i>
and such like; and the way to destroy them, is to scatter amongst your
Plants, Goose-dung, or to sprinkle the iuyce thereof with a wispe of
<i>Rue</i>, or hearbe of <i>Grace</i> ouer all the beds, and though
some with a rustie knife vse to scrape them from the leaues, and so

<p>Lastly, are your Garden <i>Wormes</i> which liuing in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span> hollowes
of the earth féede much vpon your tender Garden séedes, and the soft
sprouts which first issue from them, especially from all sorts of
kirnels, in which they delight more then in any other séede whatsoeuer,
as you may finde by experience, if you please to obserue accidents
as they happen, without which obseruation you shall hardly attaine
to the perfection of an excellent Gardner: <span class="sidenote" id="An_excellent_experiment">An excellent experiment.</span>
for if you please to make
this triall, take the kirnels of a faire sound Pippin, and deuide them
into two parts, then sowe the one halfe in a Garden bed well drest and
trimmed for the purpose, where the worme hath liberty to come and goe
at his pleasure, sowe the other halfe in some riuen boule, earthen
pot, or halfe Tub, made for the purpose with the same earth or mould
that the bed is, and then set the vessell so as no worme may come
there-vnto, and you shall finde that all those Séedes will sprout and
come forth, when hardly any one of those in the bed of earth will or
can prosper, there being no other reason but the extreame gréedinesse
of the deuouring worme, which to preuent, you shall take Oxe dung, and
burn it to ashes, then mixe them with the earth where-with you couer
your Séedes, and it will both kill the wormes, and make the Séedes
sprout both sooner and safer. And thus much for the preseruation of
Séeds and Plants, from all noysome and pestilent creatures, which being
practised with care and diligence, will giue vnto euery honest minde
the satisfaction he desireth.</p>

<p>Now to conclude this small tract or Treatise of the Husbandmans
<i>Kitchen Garden</i>, I would haue euery honest Reader vnderstand,
that I haue not taken vpon me to modell out any curious shape or
proportion, but onely figured out a perfect nourcerie, shewing you
how to bréed and bring vp all things fit for health or recreation
which being once brought to mature and ripe age, you may dispose into
those proper places which may become their worthinesse, in which worke
I would haue your owne fancy your owne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span> directour, for I may giue
preheminence to that you least like, and disestéeme that most which
to you may séeme most worthy, therefore let your owne iudgement order
your Garden, like your house, and your hearbs like your furniture,
placing the best in the best places, &amp; such as are most conspicuous,
and the rest according to their dignities in more inferiour roomes,
remembring that your galleries, great chambers, and lodgings of state
doe deserue Arras, your Hall Wainscote, and your meanest offices some
<i>Boscadge</i>, or cleanly painting: from this alligorie if you can
draw any wit, you may finde without my further instruction how to frame
Gardens of all sorts to your owne contentment.</p>

<p class="noindent drop-cap2">It is a Maxime held in Plantations, that no land is
habitable, which hath not Wood &amp; Water, they two being as it were
the only nerues &amp; strength of a mans safe and wholesome liuing, and
I haue heard many wise Gentlemen, exercised, and ingaged, in the
most noble and euer laudable workes of our new Plantations, both of
<i>Virgina</i> and the Summer-<i>Ilands</i> affirme, that they had
rather, for a generall profit, haue a fertile wholesome land, with
much wood, then (wanting wood) with a Mine of gold: so infinite great
is the vse of Timber (whose particulars I néede not rehearse) and so
insufferable is the want, when we are any way pinched with the same.
And hence it springeth that our olde auncestors (whose vertues would
God we would in some small measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span> imitate) when they found any hard
and barraine earth, such as was vnapt for grasse; or at least such as
bare but grasse that would kéepe life, not comfort life, they presently
plowed it vp, and sowed thereon Acornes, Ash-keyes, Maple knots, Béech
apples, Hawes, Slowes, Nuts, Bullis, and all other séeds of trées in
innumerable quantity, as may appeare by the Forrests of <i>Del la
mere</i>, <i>Sherwood</i>, <i>Kings wood</i>, and many other within
this kingdome of huge great spaciousnes and compasse, from whom when
the wood is spoiled, the soyle serueth to little or no purpose, except
it be the kéeping aliue of a few poore shéepe, which yéeld but little
profit more then their carkasse. Thus euen from the first age of the
world hath our forefathers béene euer most carefull to preserue and
encrease wood, and for mine owne part I haue euer obserued in all those
places where I haue séene Woods decayed and destroyed, that the charge
of stubbing and other necessaries allowed; those lands haue neuer
againe yéelded the former profit, for the greatest exhaustment that
euer I saw of wood ground was to bring it to tenne shillings an Acre
when it was conuerted to pasture, and being kept to wood, it was worth
euery seauentéenth yéere one and twenty pound. A simple Auditor may
cast the account of this profit, but such is our gréedinesse, that for
our instant vse we little respect the good of ours, or our neighbours.
But it is no part of my Bookes method to call offences to question, but
onely to right the Husbandman in his iourney to ordinarie profit. <span class="sidenote" id="The_excellent_vses_of_Wood">The excellent vses of Wood.</span>
Know
then that there is nothing more profitable to the Husbandman, then the
encreasing and nourishing of wood; from whence (as our common lawes
termes it) springs these thrée bootes or necessary commodities, to wit
House-boote, Plowe-boote, and Fire-boote, without the first we haue
neither health, couert, ease, nor safety from sauage beasts: without
the second we cannot haue the fruits of the earth, nor sustenance for
our bodies, nor without the last can we defend off the sharp Winters,
or maintaine life against the numbing colds which would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> confound vs.
The consideration of these thrée things only, might enduce vs to the
preseruation of this most excellent commodity: but the other infinite
necessities &amp; vses which we make of wood, as shipping, by which we make
our selues Lords of the Seas: fencing which is the bond of concord
amongst neighbours: solution &amp; trial of Mines, from whence springs both
our glory in peace, and our strength in warre, with a world of others
sutable vnto them, should be motiues vnresistable to make vs with all
diligence hast to the most praise-worthy labour of planting wood, in
euery place and corner, where it may any way conueniently be receiued.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_plantation_of_Wood">The plantation of Wood.</span>

<p>If then the Husbandman shall liue in a high barraine Countrey (for
low-valleyes, marshes, or such grounds as are subiect to inundations,
seldome nourish wood well) or in a soyle though not vtterly barraine,
yet of so hard and sower encrease, that the hearbage doth in the profit
but in small quantity, I would wish him after a generall triall of
his earth, to deuide it into thrée equall parts, the first and the
fruitfullest I would haue him preserue for pasture for his Cattell of
all kindes: the second and next in fertility for corne, being no more
then those cattell may till, and the last &amp; most barraine to imploy
for wood: which though he stay long for the profit, yet will pay the
interest double. And this ground thus chosen for wood, I would haue
him plowe vp from the swarth about the latter end of Februarie, and
if it be light earth, as either sand, grauell, or a mixt hazel earth,
then immediatly to sow it with Acornes, Ash-keyes, Elme &amp; Maple knots,
Béech-apples, Chesnuts, Ceruisses, Crabs, Peares, Nuts of all kindes,
Hawes, Hips, Bullice, Slowes, and all manner of other wood séeds
whatsoeuer, and as soone as they are sowne with strong Oxe harrowes of
iron, to harrow and breake the earth, in such sort, that they may be
close and safely couered. And in the plowing of this earth, you must
diligently obserue to turne vp your furrowes as déepe as is possible,
that the séede taking strong and déepe roote, may the better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span> and with
more safety encrease, and defend it selfe against stormes and tempests,
whereas if the roote be but weakely fixed, the smallest blasts will
shake the Trées, and make them crooked, wrythen, and for small vse but
fire onely.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_fencing_of_young_woods">The fencing of young woods.</span>


<p>After you haue harrowed your earth, and laide your séede safe, you
shall fence your ground about with a strong and large fence, and
hedge, ditch, pale, or such like, which may kéepe out all manner of
foure-footed beasts, for comming within the same, for the space of
tenne yéeres after: for you shall vnderstand, that if any cattell
shall come where young wood is péeping aboue the earth, or whilst it
is young, tender, and soft, they will naturally crop and brouse vpon
the same, and then be sure that the wood which is so bitten, will neuer
prosper or spring vp to any height, but turne to bushie shrubs and
ill-fauoured tufts, pestring the ground without any hope of profit,
whereas if it be defended and kept safe the space of tenne yéeres at
the least, it will after defend it selfe, and prosper in despight
of any iniurie: <span class="sidenote" id="When_cattell_may_graze">When cattell may graze in Springs.</span>
and then after that date you may safely turne your
cattell into the same, and let them graze at pleasure, and surely you
shall finde it a great reliefe for your young beast, as your yearling
Haiffers, Bullocks, Colts, Fillies, and such like: for I would not wish
you to let any elder cattell come within the same, because the grasse
though it be long, yet it is sower and scowring, and by that meanes
will make your cattell for labour weake and vnhealthie, whether it be
Oxe or Horse, and for milch-Kine, it will instantly dry vp their milke,
but for idle heilding beasts, whose profit is comming after, it will
serue sufficiently.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_vse_of_the_clay">The vse of the clay ground for Wood.</span>

<p>Now if the earth whereon you sowe your wood, be a stiffe clay ground,
and onely barraine through the extreamitie of colde, wet, or such like,
as is séene in daily experience: you shall then plowe vp the ground at
the end of Ianuarie in déepe furrowes, as is before rehearsed; and then
let it rest till it haue receiued two or thrée good Frosts, then after
those Frosts some wet, as either snow or raine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span> and then the next
faire season after sowe it, as afore-said, and harrow it, and you shall
sée the mould breake and couer most kindely, which without this baite,
and order, it would not doe, then fence it as afore-said, and preserue
it from cattell for tenne yéeres after.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="A_speciall_note">A speciall note.</span>

<p>And here is to be noted that one Oake growing vpon a clay ground, is
worth any fiue which growes vpon the sand, for it is more hard, more
tough, and of much longer indurance, not so apt to teare, ryue, or
consume, either with Lyme, Rubbish, or any casuall moysture, whence
it comes that euer your Ship-wrights or Mill-wrights desire the clay
Oake for their vse, and the Ioyner the sand Oake for smoothnesse and
waynscote. And thus much for the sowing of Wood, and his generall vses.</p>

<p class="noindent drop-cap2">Whosoeuer be a Lord or Master of much vnder-wood, which
is indéede young spring-wood of all kindes, growing thicke and close
together, either from the séede, as is declared in the former Chapter,
or from the rootes of former salles, the first being a profit begotten
by him selfe, the other a right left by purchase or inheritance, and
desire, as it is the dutie of euery vertuous husband, to make his
best and most lawfullest profit thereof, hauing not left vnto him any
president of former commodity. In this case you shall suruay the whole
circuit of your wood, with euery corner and angle there vnto belonging,
and then as your abilitie and the quantity of your ground shall afford,
you shall deuide your whole wood either into twelue, seauentéene, or
one and twenty parts of equall Acres, Roodes, or Rods, and euery yeare
you shall sell or take to your owne vse one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span> those parts, so that
one following yearely after another, our sales may continue time out
of minde, and you shall imploy as you please so much wood euery yeare
of either twelue, seauentéene, or one and twenty yeares growth. And in
this you shal note that the sale of one and twenty, doth farre excéede
that of seauentéene, and that of seauentéene as farre that of twelue:
but in this it is quantity, and your necessity that must direct you,
and not my demonstration: <span class="sidenote" id="The_valew_of_vnder-vvood">The valew of vnder-wood.</span>
for there be fewe Husbands but know that an
Acre of one and twenty yéeres growth, may be worth twenty, nay thirty
pounds, that of seauentéene worth eight or ten pounds, and that of
twelue, fiue and sixe pounds, according to the goodnesse of the wood,
insomuch that the longer a man is able to stay, the greater sure is
his profit: but fewell and fence must of necessity be had, and if a
man haue but twelue acres of wood, I sée not but he must be forced to
take euery yéere one acre for his owne reliefe, and if hée take more,
hée must either necessarily spoyle all, or driue himselfe into extreame
want in fewe yeares following: and therefore it is méete that euery
good husband shape his garment according to his cloath, and onely take
plenty where plenty is; yet with this husbandly caution that euer the
elder your sale is, the richer it is, as you may perceiue by the well
husbanded Woods of many Bishoprickes in this land, which are not cut
but at thirtie yeares growth.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_sale_of_vnder-vvoods">Of the sale of vnder-woods.</span>

<p>When you haue made your deuisions according to your quantity, you
shall begin your sale at an out-side where cariages may enter without
impeachment to the springs you intend not to cut, and a pole or halfe
pole according to the quantity of ground, you shall preserue (being
next of all to the outmost fence) to repaire the ring fences of your
Wood, and to seperate the new sale from the standing Wood: and this
amongst Woodwards is called Plash-pole. Then at the latter end of
Ianuarie you may begin to cut downe your vnder-wood, and sell it either
by acres, roodes, perches, poles, roddes, or dozens, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span> to the
quantitie of your earth, or the abilitie of your buyers. And in this
sale I cannot set you downe any certaine price, because true iudgement,
and the goodnesse of your wood must onely giue you direction, things
being euer valewed according to their worth and substance, and this
sale or the cutting downe of vnder-wood, you may continue from the
latter end of Ianuarie, till midde Aprill, at which time the leafe
begins to bud forth, or somewhat longer if necessitie vrge you: the
like you may also doe from the beginning of September, at which time
the leafe beginnes to shed till the middest of Nouember.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="How_to_cut_vnder-vvoods">How to cut vnder-woods.</span>

<p>Now for the manner of cutting downe your vnder-woods, although the
lawes of the Kingdome shew you what dutie you shall performe therein,
what Timber you shall preserue, and how néere each Weauer shall stand
one to another, yet I would wish you both for your owne and the
Common-wealths sake, to performe somewhat more then that to which you
are by law compelled, &amp; therefore you shall giue direction to your
wood fallers, that when they shall méete with any faire and straight
well growne sapling, Oake, Elme, Ash, or such like, to preserue them,
and let them stand still, being of such fit distance one from another,
that they may not hinder or trouble each other in their growing, and
when you shall finde vpon a cluster many faire Plants or Saplings; you
shall view which is the fairest of them all, and it preserue onely, and
the rest cut away, that it may prosper the better: also if you finde
any faire and well growne fruit Trées, as Peares, Chesnuts, Seruisses,
and such like, you shall let them stand and cleare them from the
droppings of the taller trées, and you shall finde the profit make you
recompence. Now for the generall cutting vp of the wood, you shall cut
it about sixe inches aboue the ground, and drawing your strokes vpward,
cut the wood slope-wise, for that is best to hasten on the new Spring;
and those Weauers or young which you preserue and suffer to growe
still, you shall prune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> and trimme as you passe by them, cutting away
all superfluous branches, twigges, and young spyers, which shall grow
either néere vnto the roote, or vpon any part of the boale, which is
fit to be preserued for Timber, and if you shall finde that the earth
haue by any casualty forsaken the root, and left it bare, which is
hurtfull to the growth of the Trée, you shall lay fresh earth vnto it,
and ram the same hard and fast about it.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_fencing_of_salles">The fencing of salles.</span>


<p>Thus when you haue made an end of cutting downe your sale, and that
the wood is cleansed and carried away, and all the loose and scattered
stickes raked vp into seuerall heapes, and caried away also; for it is
the part of euerie good husband and Woodward, not to sée any wood lye
and rot vpon the ground; you shall then with the vnder-wood preserued
in the Plash-pole, deuide by a strong hedge this new cut downe sale
from the other elder growne wood, and for tenne yéeres, as before is
spoken, not suffer any foure-footed beast to come within the same; <span class="sidenote" id="The_Woodwards_duty">The Woodwards duty.</span>
from
which rule you shall learne this lesson, that it is the Woodwards duty
euery day to looke ouer all his young Springs, and if by any mischance
or negligence cattell shall happen to breake into them (as many times
they doe) then shall he not onely driue forth or impound such Cattell,
but also suruay how farre and which Plants they haue cropt, and hauing
spied them, with his wood Bill, presently cut the Plants so brouzed
close by the bottomes of the last shuts, and then they will newly put
forth againe, as well as if they had neuer béene hindred: which done,
he shall finde out where the cattell brake in; and then mend the same,
so well and sufficiently, that it may preuent the like mischiefe.
Also if these young springs shall stand néere vnto Forrests or elder
Woods, which are full of wilde Deare, and be no purlewes belonging vnto
the same, the Woodward then shall neuer walke without a little dogge
following him, with which he shall chase such Deare out of his young
springs, because it is to be vnderstood, that the brouzing of Deare is
as hurtfull to young wood, as that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span> any other cattell whatsoeuer.
And thus much touching the ordering and gouernment of vnder-woods, with
their sales, and the nourishing vp of greater Timber.</p>

<p class="noindent drop-cap2">High Woods are those which containe onely Trées for Timber, and are not
pestred or imbraced with the vnder growth of small brush wood, such
as Hazels, White-thorne, Sallowes and Poplar are; these for the most
part consist of Oakes, Ash, Elme, Béech, Maple, and such like, growing
so remote and seperate one from another, that although their tops and
branches méete, and as it were infolde one within another, yet at
the rootes a man may walke or ride about them without trouble. <span class="sidenote" id="The_beginning_of_high_Woods">The beginning of high Woods.</span>
These
high Woods had their first beginnings from the séeds, as was before
declared, and nourisht from age to age amongst the vnder-woods, which,
when men began to want foode for their bréede-Cattell, and that from
the super-abundance of young Woods, they found some might conueniently
be spared, they forth-with in stead of cutting downe their young wood
aboue the earth, began to digge it vp by the rootes, and with stubbe
Axes to teare the meane sinewes from the ground, so that it might not
renew or encrease againe, and then leuelling the earth, and laying it
smooth and plaine, to leaue nothing standing but the tall Timber trées,
betwéene which the grasse had more libertie to growe, and Cattell more
abundance to féede on, and all be not so long and well able to fill the
mouth, as that which growes in the thicke springs, yet much more swéet
and better able to nourish any thing that shall graze vpon the same, by
reason that the Sunne and Frosts hauing more frée power to enter into
the ground, the earth is so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span> the better seasoned, and bringeth
forth her encrease with more swéetnesse.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_Plantation_of_high_Woods">The Plantation of high Woods.</span>

<p>Some are of opinion, that these high Woods may as well be planted as
sowne, and that many of them from the first beginning haue béene so,
to which opinion I consent in part: for doubtlesse I am perswaded,
that many small Groues of Ash, Elme, Béech and Poplar haue béene
planted, for we sée in our daily experience, and the new walkes in
<i>More-fields</i> by <i>London</i>, are a perfect testimonie, that
such Plantations may be without trouble or danger: but for the Oake
to be taken vp and replanted, is very hard, and very seldome in vse,
neither shall a man in an whole Age sée any Oake remoued come to
perfection or goodnesse, but growe crooked, knottie, and at the best,
but for the vse of fewell onely: but for the other before rehearsed,
you may remoue them when they are a dozen yeares of age, and plant them
where you please: and if the earth haue in it any goodnesse at all,
they will take root and grow both spéedily, and plentifully. And since
I am thus farre entred into the plantation of Woods, I will shew you
how you shall plant and remoue euery Trée in his due manner and season.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Planting_the_Elme">Of Planting the Elme.</span>

<p>And first for the planting of the Elme, which is an excellent Trée for
shadow, and the adorning of walkes or dwelling houses, you shall make
choise of those Plants which are straightest, soundest, the barke euen
and vntwound, and at least eightéene or twenty inches in compasse:
these you shall digge out of the ground, roote and all, then at the
top of the head, about thrée fingers vnder the knot, where the maine
armes seuerally issue forth, you shall a little slope-wise cut the head
cleane off them, and mixing clay and a little horse-dung, or fine ashes
together, couer the head round about there-with, then ouer the same
wrap Mosse, or fine Hay, and binde it about with soft clouen Oziers,
or some such like bands, then with a sharpe pruning Bill cut euery
seuerall branch of the roote within a finger or two of the stocke;
which done, and the roote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span> pickt cleane, you shall make a hole to be
digged in the place, where you meane to plant the Elme iust of that
depth, the hole was from whence you digged out the Elme, that so much
and no more of the Elme may be hidden in the earth, then was formerly
at his remouing; and this hole you shall make spacious and easie; and
that the mould be soft and loose both vnderneath and round about the
roote of the Elme, which done, you shall place your Elme in the same,
straight and vpright, without either swaruing one way or other, which
for your better certaintie, you may proue either with plumbe, leuell,
or other instrument, which being perfected, you shall with rich fresh
mould well mixt with olde meanure, couer and ram the same fast in the
earth, in such sort, that no reasonable strength may moue or shake it:
and all this worke must be done in the encrease of the Moone, either in
the moneth of October, or at the latter end of Ianuary: but the latter
end of Ianuarie is euer helde the best and safest, for there is no
question but you shall sée flourishing Trées the next Summer after: and
in this sort you may likewise remoue either Béech, Witcher, or Popler,
bestowing them either in Groues, Walkes, Hedge-rowes, or other places
of shadow, as shall séeme best to your contentment: for their natures
being alike, their growthes and flourishings haue little difference.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Planting_the_Ash">Of Planting the Ash.</span>


<p>Now for the replanting or remouing the Ash, though not much, yet there
is some difference, for it is not at the first so spéedie a putter
forth, and flourisher, as the others be: but for the first yeare
laboureth more to bestow and fixe his roote in the earth, then to
spread forth his vpper branches, and although some Woodwards are of
opinion, that so much as the Ash is aboue the ground, so much hée will
be vnder before he begin to flourish outwardly, yet experience doth
find it erronious, for though it be for the first yéere a little slower
then other Trées, yet when it beginneth to flourish, it will ouer-take
the spéediest grower. Therefore when you do intend to plant Ashes for a
spéedy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span> profit, you shall not according to the olde custome chuse the
smooth, small, long Plants, which are hardly thrée inches in compasse,
and haue put out hardly any branches, and are such as grow from the
rootes of elder Ashes cut downe before, which our auncient Woodwards
haue vsed to slip or cleaue from those rootes, no, these are the
worst sorts of Plants: but you shall take the true ground-Ash, which
springeth from his owne proper roote, being smooth, euen, sound, and
straight without bruise, canker, or other impediment. This you shall
digge vp by the root, being as is before said almost twenty inches in
compasse, and hauing cleansed the roote, you shall leaue each spray
not aboue halfe a foote, or eight inches in length; but for the small
thréeds or tassels of the roote, those you shall cut cleane away close
by the wood, and so plant it in euery point, as was shewed you for the
planting of the Elme, onely the top thereof you shall by no meanes cut
off, because it is a trée of pith, which to deuide or lay bare, were
very dangerous; and the best season for the planting of this Trée, is
euer in the encrease of the Moone, at the fall of the leafe, which is
from the beginning of October till midde Nouember, and at no other
time, for it would euer haue a whole Winter to fasten his roote, and to
gather strength, that it may bud forth his leafe the Summer following.
Thus you sée how you may plant Groues or Copses at your pleasure, and
make vnto your selfe high Woods according to your owne pleasure. <span class="sidenote" id="Obiection">Obiection.</span>

But
you will obiect vnto me, that you liue in such a champaine Countrey,
that albe these Plantations might bréede vnto you infinite pleasure,
yet the pouerty thereof in wood is such that these Plants are not
there to be found for any money. <span class="sidenote" id="Answere">Answere.</span>
To which I thus answere, That in this
Kingdome there is not any Country so barraine, or farre off remote from
wood, being a soyle fit to receiue wood: But his next neighbour-Country
is able to furnish him, especially with these Plants at an easie
reckoning: as for example, I hold <i>Northampton</i> shire one of the
barrennest for Wood, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> best able to beare wood, and hath not he his
neighbour <i>Huntington</i> shire and <i>Leicester</i> shire about
him, where nurceries of these Plants are bred and preserued for the
sale onely: Nay, euen in <i>Holland</i>, in <i>Lincolne</i> shire,
which is the lowest of all Countries, and most vnlikely to holde such a
commodity, I haue séene as goodly Timber as in any Forrest or Chase of
this Kingdome: and thus much for the planting of high Woods.</p>

<p class="noindent drop-cap2">It is not sufficient for the Husbandman to sowe, plant, and encrease
wood about his grounds, conuerting his earth to the vttermost and
extreamest profit that may spring from the same: but he must also
be diligent to preserue and nourish his timber trées from all
inconueniences that may any way annoy or afflict them: and to this
end hée shall daily walke into his Woods, and with a searching eye
suruay euery Trée which is of any account, and sée if he can finde any
fault or annoyance about the same, and if casting his eye vp to the
top, where the maine armes shoote forth themselues, he perceiue that
by the breaking off of some arme or other riuen boughes, the wet and
droppings of the leaues is sunke and fretted into the Timber, which in
time will corrupt the heart, and make the Trée hollow. In this case he
shall presently mount the Trée, and with his Bill, either cut the place
so smooth that the wet may not rest thereon, or else hauing smoothed
it so much as he may with conuenience, mixe stiffe clay and fine hay

cannot encrease or prosper: in this case he shall with a sharpe drawing
knife, made in the proportion of a narrow <i>C</i> draw and open the
barke euen from the top of the bole of the Trée downe to the roote, and
then clap Oxe dung into those slits, let the Trée rest, and in short

they will soone make larger, he shall forth-with besmeare all the place

<p>If he shall finde that by the droppings of other Trées, some of his
Trées shall grow cankerous, and loose their barke, which is an accident
very vsuall, and the Trées whose barkes are so lost, will with great
difficulty after prosper. In this case he shall annoynt the place with
Tarre and Oyle mixt together, and then couer the place with clay, where
the barke is wanting.</p>

<p>If he shall perceiue any <i>Pismyer</i> hilles or beds to be made

the quicke Wood, and make the place smooth and euen where they were

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_sale_of_tall_Woods">Of the sale of tall Woods.</span>

<p>Now when either necessity or the vrgent occasions of any néedfull vse,
enforceth the Husbandman to make sale of any part of his tall Wood,
in which Marchandise there is many prety and obscure secrets, such as
are hard to be shewed by any Verball demonstration, for truly there
is not any trucking or marting whatsoeuer, in which a man may sooner
deceiue, or be deceiued, men buying and selling in a manner hood-winkt:
for it is most certaine that no man can certainely tell either what
peny-woorth hée selleth, or the other buyeth, so long as the Trée is
standing, there be in Trées so many secret faults, and likewise when
they are downe, and come to the breaking or burkning (as the Wood-man
tearmes it) so many vnexpected vertues, as for mine owne part I haue
often séene a Trée whose out-side hath promised all good hope, the
barke being smooth and euen, the body large and great, and the armes
high set on, and spaciously extended; yet when this Trée hath béene
felled, and came to burkning, there hath béene found a hole in the
top, which hath runne cleane though the heart, and vtterly spoyled the
whole Timber: so likewise on the contrary part I haue séene a Trée very
foule at the top, which is suspitious for rottennesse, whose armes haue
growne so close and narrow together, that they haue promised little
burthen, yet being cut downe, I haue séene that Trée passing sound, the
armes double the loades in valuation, and the price being lesse then
any, the proofe and goodnesse to excéede all; so that I must conclude
it all together impossible to set downe any fixed or certaine rules
either for the buyer or seller: but for as much as there are diuers
worthie obseruances for both parts, and that it is as necessary to buy
well as sell well, I will runne through euery particular obseruation,
which doth belong both to the one and the other partie, with which
when a mans minde is perfectly acquainted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> he may with much bolder
confidence aduenture to buy or sell in the open Market.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="How_to_chuse_Timbers">How to chuse Timbers.</span>


<p>The first thing therefore that either buyer or seller should be
skilfull in, is the choyse of all sorts of Timbers, and to know which
is fit for euery seuerall purpose, the crooked and vneyely being for
some vses of much higher price and reckoning then that which is plaine,
straight, and euen growne, as thus for example. <span class="sidenote" id="Of_Mill_Timber">Of Mill Timber.</span>

If you would buy Timber
for Mill-whéeles, the heads of round Turrets, or any kinde of any worke
whatsoeuer, you shall chuse that which is crooked and some-what bent,
being sound, firme, and vnshaken. <span class="sidenote" id="Timber_to_beare_burthen">Timber to beare burthen.</span>
If you will chuse Timber for Summer
Trées, Baulks, Iawnies, or Tracens, you shall chuse that which is most
hartie, sound, and much twound, or as it were wrythen about, which you
shall with great ease perceiue by the twinding or crooked going about
of the barke, the graine whereof will as it were circle and lay round
about the Trée. This Timber which is thus twound or wrythen, will by no
meanes ryue or cleaue asunder, and therefore is estéemed the best to
support and beare burthen, and the heart thereof will endure and last
the longest.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Timber_for_Pales_Wainscote">Timber for Pales, Wainscote, &amp;c.</span>

<p>If you will chuse Timber for Pales, Singles, Coopers-ware, Wainscote,
or such like, then you shall euer chuse that which is smooth, euen, and
straight growne, without any manner of twynding or shaking, which you
shall perceiue by the straight and euen growing vp of the barke, whose
crests will ascend straight and vpright, euen from the roote to the
bottome, which is an assured token that all such Timber will shiuer and
ryue into as thinne parts as a man would desire.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Timber_for_Pyles_or_Water-workes">Timber for Pyles or Water-workes.</span>

<p>Lastly, if you would chuse Timber to make Pyles of, to driue into the
earth, for the framing of Weares within the water, the heads of Ponds,
or any other worke within the water then you shall chuse that which is
most knottie (so it be sound) for that will driue without splitting,
and continue in the earth the longest: and of all Timbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span> the Elme
is accounted the best for this purpose, for it will continue almost
euerlastingly in the earth without rotting; yet notwithstanding, the
Oake is excellent good also: and thus much for the generall choise of
Oakes.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Vse_of_the_Elme">Vse of the Elme.</span>

<p>Now if you would chuse Timber for weather-boards, or to be vsed in
water-workes, or to make Planks for low moyst Vaults, then you shall
chuse the biggest, soundest and smoothest growne <i>Elme</i>, it is
also excellent good to make Kitchen tables of, or for boards, for the
vse of Butchers. If you will chuse the most principallest Timber, for
Cart or Waine Axel trées, for the naues of whéeles, or for any other
vse of toughnesse, you shall chuse the <i>Elme</i> onely, for it
excéedeth all other Timbers, and though some Husbandmen are of opinion,
that the <i>Elme</i> Axel-trée when it is throughly heated, is then
most apt to breake, they are much deceiued, for it will endure farre
beyond Ash or any other Timber, except Yewgh, which for the scarsity is
now of little vse in such a purpose. And herein you must obserue, that
the <i>Elme</i> which you chuse for Axel-trées must be straite, smooth,
and without knots, but that which you chuse for naues, must be most
knotty, twound, and the hardest to be broken or hewed asunder.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Vse_of_the_Ash">Vse of the Ash.</span>

<p>If you will chuse Timber for Ploughes, ordinary Axel-trées (for those
of <i>Elme</i> are speciall) the rings of whéeles harrow bulls, and
such like, then you shall chuse the fairest, straightest, biggest,
and smoothest growne Ash that you can finde, and from the roote end
vpward, you shall cut out a length of Axel-trées, aboue it a length of
shelbordes, and aboue it (if the Trée be so large) a length for heads
and Skeathes, the largest armes which are somewhat bending, you shall
elect for rings for whéeles, and so according to the bignesse of the
Ash, and as your eye can proportion out what will be made of the same,
you shall make valuation thereof.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Vse_of_the_Wall-nut_tree">Vse of the Wall-nut tree.</span>

<p>If you would chuse Timber for ioyned Tables, Cupbords, or Bedsteds,
you shall then make choise of the fairest Walnut-trée you can finde,
being olde, straight, vnknotted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> and of a high boale: and although
either Oake, or Ash will reasonably well serue for this purpose, yet
the Walnut-trée is by many degrées the best of all other, for it is
of smoothest graine, and to the eye most beautifull, prouided that by
no meanes you put it into any worke, before it be excéedingly well
seasoned.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Vse_of_the_Peare-tree">Vse of the Peare-tree.</span>

<p>If you would chuse Timber for Ioynt-stooles, Chaires, or Chests, you
shall then chuse the oldest Peare-trée so it be sound, for it is both
smooth, swéet, and delicate, and though it be a very soft Wood, yet
in any of these frames it is an excéeding long laster, and the heart
thereof will neuer bréede worme, nor will it in any time loose the
colour.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Vse_of_the_Maple">Vse of the Maple, Beech, and Poplar.</span>

<p>If you would chuse Timber for Trenchers, Dishes, or any Tourners ware,
or for any in-laying worke, you shall then make choise of the fairest
and soundest Maple, being smooth and vnknotted, for it is the plainest
graine, and the whitest Wood of all other: and although either the
Béech or Poplar will reasonably well serue for these purposes, yet is
neither the colours so good, nor the Timber so long lasting. Many other
Trées there are which may serue for many other purposes: but these are
of most vse for our English Husbandman, and will sufficiently serue to
passe through all his businesses.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Char-coale">Of Char-coale.</span>

<p>Touching Char-coale, you shall vnderstand, that Oake, Elme, and Ash,
make your longest and best enduring Coale: the Birtch the finest and
brightest Coale, and the Béech or Sallow the swiftest Coale. Now for
your small Coale, the twigges of the Birtch makes that which kindles
the soonest, and the White-thorne that which endures the longest.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="How_to_value_Timber">How to value Timber.</span>

<p>Thus when you know how to chuse euery seuerall Trée, and the true vse
and profit which can any way be made of the same, and by a practised
experience can cast by the suruay and view of a standing Wood, the
almost entire profit that may arise from the same, deuiding in your
memory how many are for euery seuerall purpose, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span> what reckoning
they may amount one with the other, and blemishing (if you buy) the
good with the bad, or making good (if you sell) the bad with those
good ones which grow néere them, you may then boldly venture into any
sale either as a buyer or seller at your pleasure, and sure if you
know (as it is fit you should doe) the Market-able prices of all sorts
of Timbers in those places, where you are either to buy or sell, as
what a Mill-post is worth, what so many inches of well squared Timber,
contayning so many foote in length, what a dozen of boards of such a
size, what so many naues, spoakes, rings, sparres, or tracens, or what
so much sound and good Plough-timber is worth, and then looking vpon a
Trée, and computing what may euery way be made of the same, allowing
the wast which will hardly sometimes defray the charge of breaking vp
the Trée, you cannot but with great ease draw into your minde the true
value of euery Trée, and the vttermost profit or losse may any way rise
from the same.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="How_to_measure_Timber">How to measure Timber by gesse.</span>

<p>And in this worke I would haue you to obserue this rule very carefully,
that is, when you come to any great Timber-trée, to fathome or embrace
it about with both your armes, and then knowing what quantity your
fathome is, and how many fathome girdleth the Trée round about, you may
from former experience giue a certaine gesse what inches of squared
Timber that Trée will beare, for if you haue found in former trials
that twice your fathome in the rough barke hath borne twenty, or two
and twenty inches squared, and now finde that the present Trée on which
you looke, is no lesse, but rather with the bigger, you may boldly
presume, that being sound, this trée can carrie no lesse square of good
Timber: and thus much for the knowledge and choise of tall Woods.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Best_seasons_for_the_sale">Best seasons for the sale.</span>


<p>Now to come to the seasons &amp; fittest times for sale of these high
Woods: you shall vnderstand that it is méete for euery good husband
which intendeth to sell any of his high Woods, to walke into the same
immediately after Christmas, &amp; whether they be in woods, Groues,
hedge-rowes, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span> other places, to marke with a special marke all those
Trées which he intendeth to sell, as well for the wéeding and cleansing
out of all such as are decayed and wasted, as also to know the true
number of both the good and bad, and thereby in some measure to compute
the profit which will arise from the same, for to make sale of them
otherwise confusedly, might bring much losse to a man happily, selling
away those that would encrease their valewes, and kéepeing them which
daily would decrease their goodnesse, or so vnorderly vnmixing his
Wood, that where one faire and good Trée would draw a mans eye from
beholding diuers which are doated, now that onely taken away, the rest
will remaine, and neuer be sale-able, and therefore euer as néere as
you can so suite and match your Trées together, that in your sales
you may neuer passe away an absolute worthie Trée: but you may euer
couple some which haue defects to goe with it, as in these dayes we sée
Warriners and Poulters sell Rabbets, a fat and a leane euer coupled
together. When you haue thus marked out what you meane to sell, and
disposed your sale according to your best profit,<span class="sidenote" id="The_time_for_Chap-men">The time for Chap-men.</span>
 after notice giuen
vnto the Country in the Market Townes néere adioyning, you shall begin
your sale the Candlemasse following, which sale you may continue all
the Spring, according to the greatnesse thereof, or the quicknesse of
buyers. Now for any rules or orders to be obserued in these sales, I
can prescribe you none certaine, because it is méete that euery one
binde himselfe to the customes of the Country in which he liueth,
whose variations are diuers, for almost euery one is seuerall, onely
in the maine they holde together, which is that they seldome make
publike sales for money downe vpon the head, but for a certaine payment
some fewe moneths after, which makes the Marchandise more lookt to,
and the sales goe away the faster; and in this the Sales-man must be
circumspect in the choise of his Chap-men, and where hée findeth any
doubt there to make one neighbour stand bound for another, as for
the earnest penny it is euer ouer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> and aboue the price, and must be
laide downe at the binding vp of the bargaine, which earnest is in
some Countries foure pence in the pound, in some eight pence, and in
some twelue pence, according to the goodnesse of the Timber, and hath
euer béene taken for a fée due to the Sales-man for his paines and
attendance: and sure if he be carefully honest, it is a merrit well
bestowed: if otherwise, it is much too much for falshood, for in him
consists the owners losse or profit, and therefore it may become any
man, of what place so euer, to take a strickt account from such an
officer: or if he haue any doubt euer to ioyne with him in commission,
another of contrary faction.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="When_to_cut_downe_Timber">When to cut downe Timber.</span>

<p>When you haue made sale of your Timber, you shall by no meanes let it
be cut downe till the end of Aprill, at which time the sap ascending
vpward, will loosen the bark, and make it come from the body of the
Trée easily. You shall cut your Timber downe close by the earth, not
digge it vp by the rootes, vnlesse you meane vtterly to destroy it, for
from the spurnes of the roote will arise new Spiers, which in processe
of time, will come to another Trée. As soone as you haue felled your
Oakes, you shall with your Axe immediatly whilst the sap is wet, take
all the barke from the body and the armes, and setting it end-wayes
as vp one by another, so place it, that the winde may passe through
it, and dry it, and then sell it to the Tanners, which will giue you a
good price therefore, according to the worth and scarsity thereof. When
your Trées are barkt, you shall then sawe the body into such lengthes
of Timber, as shall be méete for the purpose for which it is bought,
or in such sort as it may be best portable: the armes also you shall
hewe from the body, and so burken or breake them vp, as they may be fit
to be loaded: all which done, and the Timber caried away, you shall,
if you intend to haue the Wood renew, fence in the sale, and kéepe it
safe from Cattell: and thus much for the preseruation and sale of high
Woods.</p>

<p class="noindent drop-cap2">Nature which is the most perfect worke-mistresse of all things (as all
the Philosophers say) but I say our good God out of his most diuine
wisedome, hath allotted to euery soyle, if we will note it, through
the whole course of this Kingdome, particular profit to sustaine and
maintaine it, as to some Mines, to some Timber, and to some fertility
of grasse and corne, and where any one of these are, there commonly
some of the other is euer wanting, as we sée daily in our experience;
and for as much as in the fruitfull and fertill soyles of this land,
of which wée estéeme the wealthie vales, as that of <i>Essam</i>,
<i>White-horse</i>, <i>Beluoire</i>, and many others the best, there
is euer great scarsitie of Wood, the very wealthinesse of the soyle it
selfe almost denying to beare such burden, because for the most part
the stifnesse of those clayes is contrary to their growth, yet for
as much as the necessitie and vse of Wood is so great and valuable,
I would perswade euery good and worthy Husbandman, to endeauour
himselfe with all his vtmost power and strength, to plant wood in
euery conuenient place round about him, and not to take the rules
of the ignorant for his lesson, that sith neuer any did grow there,
therefore neuer any will grow there: for it is absurd and foolish: nor
to say because my auncestors haue neuer done it why should I attempt
it? These arguments are made from a false figure, and the Husbandman
must remember that his dutie is industrie, and encrease not altogether
imitation and president, and he must as seriously finde out new and
néerer profits, as hold those he hath learned: and therefore he shall
endeauour by all commendable labour to haue euer about him whatsoeuer
is necessarie for his vse: but you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> will peraduenture aunswere me, that
to plant Woods in these rich soyles, were very much losse, because the
fertilitie thereof will yéeld a much better profit. To this I reply,
that I would not haue you plant any spacious piece of ground with
wood, but onely your ditches, hedges, and such wast earthes, as almost
denie any other profit, and that the want of wood in those places may
not discourage you, to imagine that wood will not grow there. Doe but
view the cytes of euery Towne in those rich Countries, the seates
of Noblemen &amp; Gentlemens houses, and the Parks which commonly are
adioyning there-vnto, and you shall hardly sée any of them without the
fellowship &amp; acquaintance of some wood, which in times past hath béene
planted either for defence or pleasure, and from thence collect that if
wood will grow with my next neighbour, then why not with me, so long as
the soyle doth not alter. But <i>Labor vincit omnia improbus</i>, True
industrie was neuer fruitlesse. Then for the generall good both of your
selfe &amp; your neighbours, looke that you replenish all your ditches &amp;
ring fences, with good store of Quick-set, that is to say, all that lye
high, &amp; out of the danger of water, with White-thorne, Black-thorne,
and Bryer, and those which are low &amp; subiect to washing, with Willowes,
Sallowes, and Ozyers.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="How_to_set_all_sorts">How to set all sorts of Quick-set.</span>

<p>Now for as much as it is not enough to say vnto the Husbandman do
this, but that I must also shew the manner of doing thereof: I will
shew you briefly how to set all manner of Quick-sets, and first
for the white-thorne, black-thorne, bryer or such like, which must
stand frée from inundation, you shal when you enclose any piece of
ground, after you haue markt out the true breadth of your dyke vpon
the in-side thereof, and close by the verdge of the dyke, cut with
your spade a little trough, halfe a foote or there-abouts in breadth
&amp; depth, in which trough or small gutter, you shall lay the rootes
of the first rowe of your Quick-sets, so as the top ends may looke
vpward, &amp; a little bend in towards the ditch, &amp; these quick-sets you
shall place within lesse then a foot one of another: then with your
spade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span> beginning to make your ditch, you shall with the first cleane
mould, couer all the rootes close and fast, so as they will not shake
nor stirre with your hand, then hauing raised the banke of your Dyke,
and couered the lowest rowe of Quick-set more then halfe a foote, and
broken the earth so, as it may lye close and handsome together &amp; you
shall then after the same manner lay another rowe of Quick-set ouer the
first, I meane not one Quick-set directly ouer another, but the second
rowe placed as it were in the midst betwéene two of the first, though
at least halfe a foote higher: then you shall couer that row like the
former, and ouer it place a third, which shall stand directly opposite,
and ouer the first, so that in their growth the middle rowe shall as
it were grow betwéene two of the lowest, and two of the highest: and
then vpon this vppermost rowe lay the remainder of your earth, and
make your banke perfect, and in this sort finishing one yard of the
Ditch after another, you shall at length bring your labour to the end
of your desire. Now in this labour you are to obserue some speciall
things, as first to looke well vpon your Sets before you put them into
the ground, and be sure that they be gréene, young and vntainted, then
that the rootes be cleane, and no small thréeds or iagges hanging about
them. And lastly, that they stand vpright, and not aboue foure or fiue
inches without the earth at the most, then shall you looke well to the
making of your banke, and lay the earth so as it may not slip or fall
backe into the Dyke, so as the raine may wash away the mould, and leaue
the rootes bare: but let all things be done strongly and artificially.
The best seasons for this worke is the moneths of February, March,
and Aprill, or September, October, and some part of Nouember: if the
weather be dry aboue head, when you haue set your Quick-set, you
shall make a dead hedge vpon the top of the new banke, to kéepe those
Cattell which are within your ground, from breaking forth or hurting
the Quick-set: and another small fence on the lowe verdge of the Dyke
which is outward, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span> kéepe those cattell which graze without from
running into the dyke, and hurting the quick-set. Now after a spring
and fall is past, you shall suruay all your quick-set and wéede it
cleane from all manner of filthinesse that doth choake or stifle it,
and scratching the fresh mould about it giue comfort to the roote: then
if you perceiue that any of your Sets be dead, you shall plucke them
vp, and place new in the roome, and if any be blasted in part, and not
clean killed, you shall cut away so much as is blasted, and let the
rest remaine, you shall looke well to the Caterpiller and other wormes,
which mightily deuoure Quick-sets, especially in these fat Countries,
and if you finde any taint of them, destroy them as is shewed you in a
former Chapter.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Planting_of_greater_Trees">Planting of greater Trees.</span>

<p>After your Quick-set is come to the age of thrée yéeres, and that
the banke is setled and swarth growne thereon, you shall then within
the body of your hedges plant all manner of great Trées, as Ash,
Béech, Maple, and such like, and also all manner of fruit Trées, as
Aples, Peares, Plums, Wardens, and such like, and in the first thrée
yéeres be very carefull to preserue each in his true proper nature,
and doe to them all the rights which is due to their growth, and in
that time obserue which kinde of Trées in the generality prospereth
best, and agréeth most naturally with the soyle. And of those Trées
sée that you flourish your grounds most plentifully, the particular
manner of planting whereof is already formerly declared. And hence
doth <i>Kent</i> and <i>Worcester</i> shire boast of their fruit,
<i>Windsor</i>, <i>Sherwood</i> and <i>Hollam</i> shire their Oakes,
and other particular Countries their particular commodities.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_the_setting_of_Willowes">Of the setting of Willowes, &amp;c.</span>

<p>Now for the setting of Willow, Sallow and Oziers, it is a thing so
vsuall and common, that it néedeth no great Art in the relation,
yet because I would be loath that any omission should be taken for
negligence, you shall vnderstand that in setting them you must first
respect the place, which would euer be lowe and moyst, the water
sometimes washing them, sometimes cooling them, and euer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span> giuing them
comfort. Now to speake first of the Willow it would be euer planted
vpon bankes, where it may stand more dry then wet, for such prosper
best, and endure longest, as for proofe some will continue, twelue,
fiftéene nay one and twentie yéeres, where as those which are set close
by the water, will hardly endure seueral, but not aboue nine yéeres at
the most. Touching their planting, they be set two manner of wayes,
but which is the best, is not yet agréed on amongst Husbandmen. The
first is to take an Augure full as large in compasse (although much
shorter) as that where-with you boare Pumps and with it boare a hole
in the earth two-foote, and a halfe déepe, then hauing headed some of
the choysest Willowes you haue, take the fairest and straightest of
those lops, and then cutting the sloape-wise at both ends and leauing
no superfluous twigs cleauing there-vnto, put the bigger end downe very
hard into the earth, and then with the mould which came forth, with the
Augure ram the earth close and hard about the Set, so as no reasonable
strength may shake it. Now there be other Husbandmen which in stéed
of the Augure take onely an Oaken or Ash stake, of the bignesse of an
vsuall set, and with a Béetell driue it into the ground two foot and a
halfe, and then by shaking and opening the earth, pull it out againe &amp;
then put in the Set as is before shewed, and beate and tread the earth
close there-vnto, and there is no doubt of the well prospering thereof.
Now for the defects which Husbandmen finde in these two seuerall
plantings. Some say, that the Augure taketh out so much earth, that the
Set cannot but stand loose at the roote, and so wanting full hold of
the earth, either takes not at all, or continues but a little space.
Others say that the driuing in of the stake beates the earth so hard
together, that it withstandeth the passage of the tender sprouts, &amp; so
killeth the set, but both are deceiued: for these are but suppositions,
and experience daily shewes vs, that these are the best and spéediest
wayes of setting of all sorts of Willowes that euer any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> time brought
forth, and I haue knowne one man set this way two hundreth Sets in a
day, of which not one hath failed, but all prospered. Now for your
Sallowes, you shall set them, and chuse the Sets in all poynts as you
doe the Willow, onely they would be placed a little néerer the water,
for they delight some-what more in moysture, as for the Ozier it would
be set like other Quick-set in the side of bankes, so as it may almost
touch the water, and as your Willowes or Sallowes would be set a little
remote one from another, as namely tenne foote asunder: so these must
be set close together, and in thicke rowes one against another: and
these Ozier Plants you must cut from their head, being the principall
spiers which grow thereon, and then cut off their tops, leauing them
not aboue two foote long at the most, and of all other they are the
quickest in growing.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_vse_of_Willowes">The vse of Willowes, Sallowes, and Oziers.</span>

<p>And although Willow, Sallow, and Ozyer, are in our lawes estéemed but
as wéedes and no Woods, yet they be so profitable, that the Husbandman
can hardly misse them, the Willow and Sallow seruing for fence and
fewell, to make Harrowes, Cart-saddles, &amp; horse Hames, and the Ozyers,
for fish Leapes, or Wéeles for Baskets, Scuttels, Fans to winnow with,
and many other things full as necessary: therefore if you haue any
marish grounds that are vselesse, bogge-myers, or Ilands in great
riuers, let them be imployed to the nourishing of these profitable
wéedes, and by making draynes through them to giue the water passage,
you shall in small time bring them to earthes of great profit, which
consideration were it rightly wayed, there would not be halfe so much
wast ground as is in this Kingdome.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Ordering_of_the_Willow">Ordering of the Willow.</span>

<p>But to my purpose, when you haue planted these Willowes, you shall
after euery floud, sée if the water haue driuen any of them away, or
displease them, and immediately mend them, and set them vp straight
againe. If any Cattell shall pyll or barke them, you shall pull vp
such Settes, and place new in their roome.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> Your Willow set would by
no meanes be too long at the first setting, for then will neuer beare
a good head, and too short is likewise as vnprofitable, therefore it
is held to be fiue foote aboue the earth, is a length sufficient: you
may head your Willowes once in thrée yéeres, or fiue at the furthest,
and when you sée the bodies waxe hollow, you may cut them downe for the
fire, and fixe new Sets in their places.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Ordering_of_Ozier">Ordering of Ozier.</span>

<p>The Ozier to come to his true profit and season asketh much pruning
and trimming, as namely you must kéepe the stocke lowe, and neuer
aboue halfe a foote aboue the earth, you must picke them cleane from
Mosse, and from the slime and filth, which the ouer-flow of the water
will leaue vpon them: you shall prune the small spiers, and make them
grow single one by another, and if any shoote out a double stalke, you
shall cut it away, you may head them euery second yéere at the fall
onely, and though some head them once a yéere, yet it is not so good
husbandry, nor will the Ozier be so tough or long lasting. The best
seasons for the setting of the Willow, Sallow, or Ozier is, either
any part of the Spring or Fall, and the best time to loppe the Willow
or Sallow, is in the Spring for fence, and in the Fall for timber or
fewell; but the Ozier would be cut at the fall of the leafe onely. And
thus much for the bréeding of Wood in the rich champaine Countries.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent drop-cap2">Hauing alreadie sufficiently in the former Chapter spoken of the
planting of all sorts of quick-sets, it is méete now that I shew you
how to order the hedges being growne and come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> perfection. Know then
that if after your hedge is come to sixe or seauen yéeres of age, you
shall let it grow on without cutting or pruning, that then although it
grow thicke at the top, yet it will decay and grow so thinne at the
bottome, that not onely beasts but men may runne through it, and in
the end it will dye and come to nothing, which to preuent, it shall
be good once in seauen or eight yéeres to plash and lay all your
Quick-set hedges, in which there is much fine Art and cunning to be
vsed. For this plashing is a halfe cutting or deuiding of the quicke
growth, almost to the outward barke, and then laying it orderly in a
sloape manner, as you sée a cunning hedger lay a dead hedge, and then
with the smaller and more plyant branches, to wreathe and binde in
the tops, making a fence as strong as a wall, for the roote which is
more then halfe cut in sunder, putting forth new branches, which runne
and entangle themselues amongst the olde stockes, doe so thicken and
fortifie the hedge, that it is against the force of beasts impregnable.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="How_to_plash">How to plash.</span>


<p>Now to giue you some light how you shall plash a hedge, though diuers
Countries differ diuersly in these workes, yet as néere as I can I will
shew you that which of the best Husbandmen is the best estéemed. <span class="sidenote" id="The_time_of_yeare">The time of yeare.</span>
First,
for the time of yéere either February or October, is passing good, and
the encrease of the Moone would likewise be obserued.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_Tooles">The Tooles.</span>

<p>For the tooles which you shall imploy, they would be a very sharpe
nimble Hatchet, a good Bill, and a fine pruning knife. Now for the
worke you shall enter into it, first with your Bill you shall cut
away all the superfluous boughes and branches which are of no vse, or
hinder your worke, and then finding the principall stemmes which issue
from the maine roote, you shall within a foote or lesse of the ground
with your Hatchet, cut the same more then thrée quarters through, so
as they may hang together by nothing but the outward barke, and some
part of the outward sap, and this stroke must euer be sloape-wise and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
downeward: then take those mayne bodies of the quick-set, so cut, and
lay them sloape-wise from you, as you would lay a dead hedge, and
all the branches which extend from those bodies, and would spread
outwardly, you shall likewise cut as before said, and fould them
artificially into your head, and euer within a yard or two distance,
where a pretie Plant growes straight vp, you shall onely cut off the
top equall with the height of your hedge, and so let it stand as a
stake, about which you shall folde and twind all your other branches.
Now when you come to the top of the hedge, which would commonly not be
aboue fiue foote high, you shall take the longest, youngest, and most
plyant boughes, and cutting them as afore-said, gently binde in the
tops of all the rest, and so make your hedge strong and perfect: and
herein is to be noted, that the closer and thicker you lay your hedge
(so there be nothing in it superfluous) the stronger and better lasting
it will be. Many vse not to binde in the tops of their plasht hedges,
but onely to lay the Quick-set and no more: but it is not so husbandly,
neither is the hedge of any indurance: many other curiosities there be
in the plashing of hedges, but this which I haue alreadie shewed, is
sufficient both for the Husbandmans benefit and vnderstanding.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_profit_of_Plashing">The profit of Plashing.</span>

<p>The profit which ariseth from this labour, is the maintenance and
defence of fencing, the preseruing and encrease of Quick-set, and a
continuance of amitie amongst neighbours, when one liues frée from
offending another. It yéeldeth a good Mast for Swine, and with the
ouer-plus thereof at these times of plashings, repaireth all a mans
dead hedges, and brings good store of fewell both to the Brewhouse,
Kitchin, and Backhouse.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_lopping_of_Timber">The lopping of Timber.</span>

<p>Next to the plashing, is the lopping of Timber-Trées, which in those
Countries which are bare and naked of wood, is of much vse, and though
I cannot much commend it, because it oft marreth the bodies of Trées,
yet I must allow it for necessary, because it is a néedfull rate, which
the Trées pay to their Planters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote" id="What_Lopping_is">What Lopping is.</span>


<p>This lopping or heading of Trées, is the cutting off of the armes and
vppermost branches of Trées, and suffering the body to grow still, and
it may very well be done once in eight or tenne yéeres, <span class="sidenote" id="The_season_for_Lopping">The season for Lopping.</span>
either at the
beginning of the Spring, or at the end of the Fall, as you shall haue
occasion to vse the wood, and immediately after the Moone hath new
changed.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="How_you_shall_lop_Timber">How you shall lop Timber.</span>

<p>Now for the manner of the worke, there is small curiositie to be vsed
therein, if your Axe be good and sharpe, for you shall but cut off the
armes and boughes, smooth and cleane without nickes, rifts, or gutters,
or any thing which may receiue wet, whereby the Trée may be cankred
and spoyled. Also in cutting away of the armes, you shall haue a great
care rather to cut them away (if it be possible) vpward then downeward,
least when you cut them downeward, the waight of the arme sodainly
falling downe, riue and teare the barke of the body of the Trée, which
is dangerous, and hath béene the spoyle of much Timber: which to
preuent, you shall euer before you strike any blowe aboue, make a good
large nicke vnderneath, and then after cut it downe from aboue, and so
the Trée shall receiue no hurt. Also you shall obserue to cut the armes
close by the body of the Trée, and neuer to desist till you haue made
the place as playne and smooth as may be, for to doe the contrarie,
is neyther workmanly, nor the part of any good husband. And thus much
touching the plashing of Hedges, and lopping of Trées.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent drop-cap2">Hauing alreadie sufficiently entreated of errable Grounds,
Gardens, Orchards, and Woods of all kindes, I thinke it most méete
(as falling in his due place) here to write of Pasture grounds, which
are of two kindes: the first, such Pastures as lye in wood land,
mountainous, or colde climes, and are enclined to hardnesse and
barrennesse, and therefore onely imployed to the bréeding and bringing
forth of Cattell: the other such as lye in lowe, warme, and fruitfull
soyles, and are most fertile and aboundant in encrease, onely imployed
to the fatting and féeding of Cattell.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_barraine_Pastures">Of barraine Pastures.</span>


<p>And now to speake of the first sort of Pasture, which being somewhat
barraine, is preserued for bréeding, you shall vnderstand that it is
generally dispierced ouer all this Kingdome, and particularly into
euery Countrey, for according to the veanes and mixture of the earth,
such is either the richnesse or pouerty of the same, and of those
seuerall mixtures I haue spoken sufficiently before in that part of
this Booke, which entreateth of errable ground. Then to procéede to
my purpose, it is the first office of the Husbandman when he séeth
and knoweth the true nature of his earth, and perceiueth from perfect
iudgement that it is of very hard encrease, <span class="sidenote" id="Signes_of_barrainnesse">Signes of barrainnesse.</span>
which as the temper and
mixture of the soyle assures him, so also he shall better confirme by
these fewe signes and Charracters, which I will deliuer: as first, if
he sée grasse slow of growth, and that no Spring will appeare before
May. If in stead of Clouer-grasse, Dandylion, and Honisuckle, you sée
your ground furnished with Penigrasse, Bents, and Burnet. If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span> sée
much Knot-grasse or Speare-grasse, or if you perceiue the scorching of
the Sunne burne away the grasse as fast as the raine had brought it
forth: or if you finde quarries of stone néere vnto the vpper swarth of
grasse; or if your ground bring forth Lyng, Bracken, Gorse, Whynnes,
Broome, Bilburie, or Strawburie: or if your ground be morish, full of
quick-myers, mossie or full of blacke Flint, any of these signes make
it to be most apparant that the soyle is barraine and of hard encrease.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Bettering_of_soyles">Bettering of soyles.</span>


<p>And then as before I said it is the Husbandmans first office to prouide
for the bettering and perfecting of his earth, which he shall doe in
this sort. First, if he perceiue that the barrainnesse of his ground
procéedes from want of good Plants, <span class="sidenote" id="Sowing_of_good_seedes">Sowing of good seedes.</span>

as from want of Clouer-grasse,
Dandylion, Honisuckle, Cowslop, and other swéet flowers, then he shall
repaire into the fruitfull Countries, and there buy the hay séedes
and swéepings of hay-barne-flowers, which he shall euery Spring and
fall of the leafe sowe, as thin as may be, vpon such Pastures, as he
shall either lay for meddow, or preserue for the latter Spring after
Michaelmas. <span class="sidenote" id="For_abundance_of_grasse">For abundance of grasse.</span>
But if he respect not the goodnesse of grasse, but the
abundance of grasse, as those husbands doe which liue in or about
great Cities, then he shall dung those grounds which he will lay for
meddow at Candlemasse; or those which he will graze or eate in the
first beginning of the Spring, at Michaelmasse before, with the oldest
and rottennest meanure he can get, of which the best is the rotten
staddell or bottomes of Hay-stackes, or for want of it the meanure of
horse-stables, swéepings, and scowrings of yards and barnes, the mudde
of olde ditches, or else good Oxe or Cow meanure, any of which will
bring forth abundance of grasse.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_imperfection_of_meanure">The imperfection of meanure.</span>

<p>Yet thus much I must aduertise the Husbandman, that this meanuring of
Pasture grounds carries with it diuers imperfections, for though it
occasion abundance of grasse to growe, yet the meddow or hay which
comes thereof, is so ranke, loggie, and fulsome in tast, that a beast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
taketh no ioy to eate thereof, more then to holde very life and soule
together. Also the grasse thus meanured which you intend to graze or
eate with your Cattell, is by meanes of the meanure so loose at the
roote, that Cattell as they bite plucke vp both the grasse, roote, and
all, which being of strong &amp; ranke sent in the mouth of a beast, maketh
him loathe and cast it out againe, and so not striue to eate to be fat,
but onely to maintaine life.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_helpe_a_slow_Spring">To helpe a slow Spring.</span>

<p>Now if your Spring be slow, and late in the yéere before your grasse
will appeare aboue ground, it is méete then that you enclose your
ground, and not only maintaine the fences with high and thicke
Quick-sets, but also with tall Timber-trées, whose shade and strength
may defend many colde blasts from the earth, and adde vnto it a more
naturall warmenesse then it had before, for it is onely the coldnesse
of the soyle which makes the grasse long before it grow. Also in this
case it is méete that you lay (as the husbandman tearmes it) all such
Pasture as you intend to graze at the spring following, in Nouember
before, &amp; so not being bitten from that time till Aprill following, no
doubt but your spring will be both good and forward. There be others
which helpe their slow springing grounds by stocking them in the latter
end of the yéere with great abundance of shéepe, who although they bite
néere to the ground, and leaue little grasse behinde them, yet they
so tread and meanure it with their hot meanure, that it will spring
after it commeth to rest, much more early and faster then it was wont.
So that to conclude in a word, to make a barren ground spring earely,
is to kéepe it warme, let it haue long rest, and meanure it well with
Shéepe.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_help_Knot-grasse_and_Speare-grasse">To help Knot-grasse and Speare-grasse.</span>

<p>If your ground be troubled with Knot-grasse or Speare-grasse, it is a
signe of too much colde moysture in the earth, and in this case you
shall with a great common Plough, made for such a purpose, turne vp
great furrowes through your ground, and make them so descend and fall
one into another, that not onely the moysture bred in the earth, but
that which falls vpon the earth, may haue a swift passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span> from the
same, and so your soyle being drayned and kept dry, all those wéedy
kindes of grasse will soone perish.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_helpe_Sun-burning">To helpe Sun-burning.</span>


<p>If your ground be subiect to the scorching or burning of the Sunne,
then you shall vnderstand that it is directly contrary to the last
soyle we spake of: for as that by too much moysture is made barraine
by colde, so this by too much want of moysture is made barraine with
heate: wherefore the Husbandman shall in this case draw all his
draynes, to bring moysture into his ground, which sometimes watring
and sometimes ouer-flowing the same, will in the end bring it to
a reasonable fertility, for it is a rule, that where there may be
ouerflowes, <span class="sidenote" id="To_helpe_quarries_of_stone">To helpe quarries of stone.</span>
there can seldome be any hurt by Sunne-burning, vnlesse
that such soyles be vpon Limestone ground, or néere vnto other
quarries of hard stone, which lying néere vnto the vpper swarth of
the grasse, doth so burne the roote, that the vpper branches cannot
prosper. In this case the bringing in of water doth rather hurt then
good, wherefore your best course is partly by your owne industry, and
partly by the labours of others, who are traded in such commodities,
to let forth your ground to Stone-diggers or Lime-makers, who digging
the quarries out of the earth, and then filling vp the emptie places
with rubbish and other earth, the soyle will in short space become as
fruitfull as any other, for it is onely the want of taking roote; or
the burning vp of the roote, which makes this kinde of earth barraine.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_help_Ling_Braken">To help Ling, Braken, &amp;c.</span>

<p>Now if your ground bring forth Ling, Braken, Gorse, Whinnes, or such
like: you shall pare off the vpper swarth of the earth, and lay it in
the Sunne to dry, in the height or heate of Sommer, and being throughly
dried, you shall lay them in round hollow heapes one sod ouer another,
then putting fire vnto them, burne them into ashes, which done, spread
the ashes, like a meanure, ouer all the ground, and you shall sée those
wéedes will no more spring or grow in that ground.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_helpe_morishnesse_or_quick-myers">To helpe morishnesse or quick-myers.</span>

<p>If your ground be morish or full of quicke myers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span> you shall then by
small draynes or trenches draw away the water, and turne it into some
lower ditch or current, and so bringing the ground to a stability or
firmenesse, there is no doubt but fruitfulnesse, will presently follow
after.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_helpe_mossinesse">To helpe mossinesse.</span>

<p>Lastly, if your ground be mossie, and bring forth in stead of grasse
onely a soft fussie and vnwholsome mosse, your onely best way to cure
the fault, is in the Winter time to tread it much with the féete of
Cattell, as by making of Hay-stacks in diuers parts of such ground, and
so fodring your Cattell about the same, and so yéerely altering the
places of your Stackes or Réekes to goe ouer all your ground, &amp; without
doubt the treading of the ground will kill the mosse, and the meanuring
of the Cattell, and the expence of Hay-séeds vpon the ground, will
soone bring the earth to much fruitfulnesse and goodnesse.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_generall_vse_of_barraine_grounds">The generall vse of barraine grounds.</span>

<p>Now for the generall vse of these barraine grounds, it is to be
vnderstood, that albe by the meanes before shewed, they may be helpt
or bettered, yet they are but onely for bréede or encrease of Cattell.
Whether the grounds be seuerall and enclosed, or vniuersall and
common: whether they be Woods, Parkes, or Pastures, or Heathes, Mores,
Downes, or other wilde and vnlimitted places, and these grounds shall
be deuided into thrée parts, the first and most fruitfullest lying
lowest, lying néerest to the riuer or some running streame, you shall
preserue for meddow, and not suffer any beast to bite vpon the same
from Candlemasse, vntill the hay be taken from the ground. The second
part, you shall graze or eate from Candlemasse till Lammas, which would
be that which lieth most plaine and bleake, and most subiect to all
weathers. And the third part, which is the warmest and safest, you
shall graze from all-Hollantide till Candlemasse, and betwixt Lammas
and all-Hollantide you shall eate vp your eddish or after-crop of your
meddowes.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="What_Cattell_are_to_be_bred">What Cattell are to be bred.</span>

<p>Now whereas I speake generally, that these barraine grounds are for
the bréede of Cattell, yet you shall vnderstand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> me particularly, as
namely, what Cattell for what soyle, for euery barraine earth will not
bring forth Cattell alike, as some will beare a faire Cowe or Oxe, yet
but a little Horse: and some will bring forth a very goodly Horse, yet
but a very little horned beast, therefore you shall obserue that if
your ground lye any thing lowe, or be subiect to much moysture, and so
not extreamely barraine, but although the Spring be late, yet after
it springeth, it yéeldeth a reasonable bit, this ground is fittest to
bréede Cattell vpon, as Cowe, Oxe, and such like: but if it lye high
and dry, if it be stonie or mountainous, haue much reflection of the
Sunne: or though it be some-what more barraine then the former earth,
and in the best part of the Spring yéeld but a short, yet swéet bit,
this ground is fittest to bréede a faire and large horse vpon: but if
it be extreamely barraine colde and moyst, stonie or mossie, so it
be replenished with any good store of Vnderwood, then it is fit to
bréede small hard Nags vpon, or Geldings of a meaner size, Goates,
wilde-Swine, or such like. And lastly, if it be extreame barraine,
colde, and dry, and altogether without any kinde of shelter, but
subiect to euery blast whatsoeuer, this ground is fit onely to bréede
Shéepe vpon, as we sée by daily experience in the seuerall parts of
this Kingdome: so that to conclude, you shall beare in your memorie,
that where you bréede your beast, would be reasonable bit: where you
bréede your Horse good ayre and warmth, and where you bréede your
Shéepe, there much spaciousnesse of ground. And thus much briefly for
the nature and vse of your barraine grounds.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_fertill_grounds">Of fertill grounds.</span>

<p>Now to procéede to your fruitfull and rich grounds, whose very encrease
and abundance of grasse, without any other curious relation shewes
their fertility, there is little obseruation to be held in the ordering
&amp; disposing of them, for being naturally good of themselues, there
néedeth little Art to the maintainance of the same, onely to haue an
especiall care to the fencing and safe kéeping of them, to the due time
of eating them with your Cattell, and to obserue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span> a fit proportion
of rest for them, in which they may grow and gather head for the
maintainance of such beasts as shall féede vpon them. And to these, as
an especiall rule aboue the rest, must be added a carefull diligence
not to ouer-stocke or loade your ground with more Cattell then it may
conueniently beare, for if your ground be neuer so fruitfull, if it be
ouer-prest with multitudes of Cattell, it cannot by any meanes yéeld
you the profit of your expectation, but returne you losse and dammage.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_deuision_of_rich_grounds">The deuision of rich grounds.</span>

<p>These fruitfull and rich grounds would be deuided into two parts,
the one pastures, or grounds for continuall féeding or nourishing of
Cattell all the yéere, the other meddowes, from whence you shall gather
your Winters prouision of Hay, for the preseruation of your Cattell,
which are either for labour or sale in the Market, and of these two
parts I will speake seuerally.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_generall_vse_of_rich_grounds">The generall vse of rich grounds.</span>

<p>Yet before I begin to speake largely of them, it is méete you know the
generall vse of these rich and fruitfull grounds, which is indéede
the féeding or fatting vp of Cattell, either for foode in your owne
house, or for sale in the Market, to the Butcher, Drouer, or men of
such like place or profession. For indéede to bréede much vpon these
rich grounds, is neither profitable to the Husbandman, nor is the
beaste so bred, either so comely or Market-able, as those bred in the
harder soyles, as wée may note in our experience, if we will suruay the
bréedes of Cattell in <i>Gloster</i>-shire, <i>Sommerset</i>-shire,
and <i>Lincoln</i>-shire, which for the most part are bred vpon
excéeding rich and fertile ground: yet if we take view of them, we
shall finde that albe they are tall and large, yet they are of slender
shape, leane-thighed, crumple-horned, and oft tender and dry skinned,
which is a fault very note-worthie amongst Graziers, and indéede are
nothing so eyely and Market-able, as those beasts are which are bred
in <i>Yorke</i>-shire, <i>Darby</i>-shire, <i>Lancashire</i>, and such
like, all which are bred vpon hard and barraine grounds, yet haue
goodly, large, and round bodies, close trust, thicke, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span> well coupled
together, faire heads, veluet skinnes, and as the Prouerbe is, are
so beautifull in horne and haire, that they are euery mans money, in
euery Market. So that I conclude, that albe vpon the rich ground you
may bréede good Cattell, and it is necessary also so to doe for the
maintaynance of stocke, yet the generall vse, and that which is the
greatest profit to the English husbandman, is to graze and féede the
same.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Pastures_and_ordering_them">Of Pastures and ordering them.</span>

<p>Now to procéede to my former purpose, touching that part of rich ground
which I call Pasture, because it is onely for féeding, you shall first
prouide that they be very well fenced, according to the nature of the
Country, either with ditch, pale, rayle, dead hedge, or quicke-growth:
you shall also sée that they be well stored with water, that is swéet
and wholesome, for putrified water bréedeth many mortall and infectious
diseases amongst Cattell. These Pastures must euer be your highest
ground, and such as lye safest from inundations. Those Pastures which
you lay or giue rest to from the beginning of Nouember, you may féede
at Candlemasse following with heilding beasts, or such as are but
beginning to féede, but with your fat beasts not till our Ladies day
after: those Pastures which you lay or giue rest to at Candlemasse, you
may very well féede at May following: those which you giue rest to at
May-day, you may féede at Midsommer, for then the spring is swift and
plentifull: those you lay at Midsommer, you may féede at Lammas, those
you lay at Lammas, you may féede in October, and generally all the
Winter following: onely you shall obserue, that those Pastures which
lye most in danger of water, or any other casualtie, be first eaten,
least by too long delaying an vnseasonable time come, and so you be
both preuented of your hope and profit.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Manner_of_feeding_of_cattell">Manner of feeding of cattell.</span>

<p>In the eating of your Pasture grounds, are many things to be obserued,
as first for the féeding of your fat Cattell, you must by all meanes
be sure that they haue full bite, which is to say, length of grasse:
for cattell, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> tongues are the principall gatherers vp of their
foode, neither can nor will bite néere vnto the ground, except it be
extreame hunger which compels them, and then they take little ioy in
their foode. Next you shall oft (as any fit occasion will giue you
leaue) remoue and shift them into fresh grounds, and not expect that
they should eate your grasse downe to the bottome, but onely as it were
scumme and take the vppermost and choisest part thereof, and so they
will féede both swiftly and throughly: and for that grasse which they
shall leaue behinde them, you shall eate it vp after them with your
labouring or worke-cattell, and lastly with your shéepe. It is very
good also amongst your fat beasts euer to haue a leane horse or two:
for your fat beasts taketh delight to féede with them, and sometimes
to bite after them, there being as it were a kinde of sympathie or
liking of each others tastes. After your grasse is fully knit, and
hath receiued his whole strength, which wil be at Midsommer, then you
may suffer your fat beast to eate a little néerer vnto the ground
till after Lammas, because there is an extraordinarie swéetnesse
therein, springing from the heate of the Sunnes beames onely. These few
obseruations well kept, there is no doubt but your Cattell will féede
well to your contentment, then when you sée that they are sufficiently
fed, according to the ayme of your purpose, whether it be for the vse
of your houshold, or the vse of the Market, you shall forth-with imploy
them accordingly, for it is both the losse of time and money, not to
put them off by sale or otherwise, so soone as they are come to the
end of your desire. For those rich grounds will sometimes make two
returnes in the yéere, sometimes thrée, which is a great profit. And I
haue heard sometimes of foure, but it is very rare, and the Cattell so
returned must be very well stricken with flesh before they be put vnto
féeding, but if your ground will returne leane beasts fat twice through
the yéere, it is commodity sufficient.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="How_to_know_a_fat_Beast">How to know a fat Beast.</span>

<p>Now because it is not sufficient to say sell or kill your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> Cattell
when they are fat, except you haue the Art and skill to know the
same, you shall obserue these few rules following, and they will
sufficiently instruct you in the same. First, when you sée your beast
in the generall shape and composure of his body shew most faire and
beautifull, each member being comely, and each bone couered, in such
sort as a perfect shape requireth, as no eye is so stupid as cannot
tell when a beast looketh well or ill-fauouredly, you shall then guesse
the beast to be well fed, especially when you sée his huckle-bones
round and not sharpe, his ribs smooth, not rough, his flankes full, his
natch thick, and his cod round. This when you shall perceiue, you shall
handle him, and griping him vpon the neathermost ribs, if you féele
the skinne loose, and the substance soft vnder your hand, you may be
well assured that the beast is very well fed outwardly, that is vpon
the bones. You shall then lay your hand vpon his round huckle-bones,
and if that féele, vnder your hand, soft, round and plumpe, you shall
be assured that the beast is well fed both outwardly and inwardly,
that is, both in flesh and tallow: then you shall handle him at the
setting on of his taile, and if that handle bigge, thicke, full, and
soft, it is a true signe that the beast is very well fed outwardly:
then handle his natch-bones which are on both sides the setting on of
his taile, and if they féele soft and loose, it is a signe that he is
well fed, both outwardly and inwardly. Lastly, you shall handle his cod
and nauell, if it be of an Oxe, and the nauell onely if it be a Cowe,
and if they handle thicke, round, soft, great, and plumpe, it is a most
assured signe that the beast is very well tallowed within. And thus
when any of these parts or members shall handle in contrary manner,
you shall iudge of the contrary effects. And thus much touching the
knowledge of a fat beast.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_Meddowes_and_their_ordering">Of Meddowes and their ordering.</span>

<p>Now for the second part of these rich grounds, which are meddowes,
they ought to be the most fruitfullest and richest of all other, lying
low and leuell, and being now and then in the Winter season washt with
inundations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span> yet not too too much drencht or washt with the same: for
as the moderate ouerflowing of waters enricheth and fertiles the soyle,
to the too much soking or long resting of the water rotteth the earth,
&amp; bringeth it to barrainnesse, neither is it altogether necessary that
euery meddowe should lye so low that it might be ouerflowed, for there
be some high grounds which are frée from those floods which will beare
meddow in very sufficient manner, &amp; although the lower meddowes doe
abound in the plenty of grasse, yet the higher grounds euer beareth
the swéeter grasse, and it is a rule amongst Husbandmen, that the low
meddowes do fill, but the high meddowes do féede, the low are for the
Stable, but the high are for the Cratch, and that which is long will
maintaine life, but that which is short will bréede milke.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Preseruation_of_Meddowes">Preseruation of Meddowes.</span>

<p>The chiefest respect you shall haue to your meddowes, is to defend and
preserue them from Moales, and such like vermine, which roote vp the
earth, and destroy the swéet and tender roots of the grasse. Next, that
you note in what places of the meddow the water standeth longest, &amp;
from thence, by small furrowes or draynes, to giue it a frée passage,
so that the meddow may as it were cleanse &amp; be dry in one instant.
Lastly, you shall maintaine the banks of all such ditches &amp; other
fences bordring about your meddowes in good and sufficient manner, both
for kéeping out of water after your meddowes begin to grow, as also for
kéeping Cattell from eating them in the night or other times, which is
a great depriuation and losse of the profit you expect to come from
them: for you shall vnderstand, that if any ouerflow shall come vnto
your meddowes after May, it will leaue such a sandy filthinesse in the
grasse, that except very moderate showers fall swiftly, and sodainly,
to wash it out againe, the Hay which shall be got of that crop, will
both be vnsauorie and vnwholsome, and bréed in your Cattell many
dangerous and mortall sicknesses.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="When_to_lay_Meddowes">When to lay Meddowes.</span>

<p>The best times for laying of meddowes to rest, is, if the meddow
lye high, as in vp-land Countries, or if the soyle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> be cold, or the
springing thereof slow, at Candlemasse: but if the ground be more
warme, temperate, &amp; of some more fertility, then you may lay it at
our Ladies day in March: but if the ground be most fruitfull, then if
you lay it at May-day, it will be early enough. Also in the laying of
your meddowes to rest, you shall consider the state of the ground, as
whether it be eaten néere and bare, and with what Cattell, as Horse,
Oxen, or Shéepe: if it haue béene eaten bare with Oxen or Horse, then
you shall lay it earlier in the yéere, for it will aske a longer time
to grow againe: but if it haue béene eaten with Shéepe (although they
bite néerest to the ground) yet you may lay it so much later, because
the meanure which they bestow vpon such good ground, will quickly
hasten on the Spring: but if your meddowes haue not béene eaten bare,
but haue a good déepe fogge vpon them still, then you may lay them the
latest. Also in the laying of meddowes, you shall consider whether
they be common or priuate, if they be common meddowes, and that no
olde custome binde you to the contrary, you shall lay them to rest
earely in the yéere, that recouering a forward Spring, you may cut
them so much the sooner, and so haue the better after-crop, and the
longer time to eate it: but if your meddow be priuate, and at your owne
particular disposing, then you shall lay it according to your owne
necessitie, and the goodnes of the soyle, obseruing euer to giue it
full time of growth, and not to cut it till the grasse be full ripe,
for it is better to let it grow a wéeke too long (so the weather be
seasonable for the withering of it) then to cut it two dayes too soone,
because when it is too earely cut, it not onely looseth the strength
and goodnesse, but also the substance and waight, and in the drying
shrinketh and wasteth to nothing.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="When_to_mow_Meddowes">When to mow Meddowes.</span>

<p>Touching the fittest time to cut or mowe your meddowes: If they be
laid in a due season, it is held of all the best English husbandmen
generally to be a wéeke or a fortnight after Midsommer day, as namely
about the translation of Thomas, which is euer the seauentéenth day of
Iuly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> and without question it is a very good time for all men to begin
that labour, if their grounds be fruitfull and of earely growth: but
in as much as diuers grounds are diuers in their growth, some being
much more hastie then other some: and for as much as some meddow may
as well grow too long as too little a time, as in high land Countries,
where the heate and reflection of the Sunne will burne and consume away
the grasse, if it be not gathered in a due season, I would therefore
wish euery good Husbandman about a wéeke before Midsommer, and a wéeke
after, to view his meddowes well, and if he sée them turne browne, if
the Cock-heads turne downeward and stand not vpright, if the Bels and
other vessels of séede open and shed their séedes, if your Honisuckles
haue lost their flowers, and the Penigrasse be hard, dry, and withered,
then you shall truly vnderstand that your meddow is ripe and ready
to be mowne, and the longer it standeth, the more it will loose of
the substance, and when any of the contrary signes appeare, as when
the meddow lookes gréene and fresh, the Cock-heads looke vpright, the
Bels are close and hard, the Honisuckles flowing and purple, and the
Penigrasse soft and moyst, then is your meddow not readie to cut, nor
will the Hay that is so gotten be other then soft, fuzzie, and most
vnwholsome, no beast taking delight to eate of the same.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_inclination_of_the_weather">The inclination of the weather.</span>

<p>Now to these considerations, you shall adde a carefull obseruation
of the state and inclination of the weather, and if you finde that
the weather is disposed to much wet or incertaintie, then you shall
forbeare to mowe, because that moysture will still maintaine and hold
the grasse in his perfect strength so long as it groweth: but if it be
once cut downe, then the wet will soone rot and spoile it: but if you
find the weather enclined to drought and fairenesse, then you shall
with all spéede cut downe your Hay, for one loade got and brought into
the barne without raine, is worth two that hath béene washt, though
but with the smallest shower. There be some Husbandmen that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span> the
mowing of their meddowes, will obserue the state of the Moone, and
other planetarie coniectures, but they are fitter for those which
séeke curiosities more then profit, for mine owne part I would wish
euery good husband but to know truly when his crop is ripe, and then
to gather it in the most constant and fairest seasons, which the rules
already set downe will most amply shew him.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_manner_how_to_mowe_Meddowes">The manner how to mowe Meddowes.</span>

<p>Now for the manner of mowing your meddowes, although the generall act
resteth in the hands of the mower, and that it is hard and impossible,
in words, to expresse the Art of the action, nor is it néedfull that
euery Husbandman be a mower, yet for those rules which the English
Husbandman should know and obserue, I will in no sort omit them. You
shall then know that in the mowing of your meddowes you shall mowe them
smooth, plaine, and leuell, and as the Husbandman tearmes it, with such
an euen board, that a man may no more but discerne the going in and
comming forth of the Sythe: and this shall be done so close and néere
vnto the ground, as is possible for the worke-man to get, especially if
it be in publique and common meddowes, because the swap and first crop
is all the maine profit you can challenge your owne: nay, you shall
doe it also in your owne priuate and seuerall meddowes: for although
an ignorant custome haue drawne some of our Husbandmen, to say and
beléeue that there is no losse in the sleight and insufficient mowing
of priuate meddowes, because say they, what I loose in the Barne,
my Cattell findes on the ground, yet they are much deceiued in that
opinion, for what they so leaue on the ground halfe cut halfe vncut, is
no good foode, neither pleasant nor sauorie, but dry, hard, and bitter,
and indéede no better then sower fogge, which may fill, but cannot
nourish, and who then will be so simple, as not to preferre swéet Hay
before such vnsauorie grasse? therefore be carefull to mowe your grasse
euen, and close by the ground, for it will make the fresh grasse spring
vp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span> with more ease, and be much pleasanter in taste.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="How_to_make_Hay">How to make Hay.</span>

<p>Next after the mowing of your meddowes, followeth the making of your
Hay, which is a labour that must be followed with great care and
diligence, for it is an old saying, that dearth beginneth at the
Hay-barne dore, and he that is negligent in that, can hardly be good
husband in any thing else, then to shew you how you shall make your
hay, you shall first vnderstand that no one particular forme can stand
for a generall rule, because Hay must be made according to the nature
of the grasse, and the soyle where it groweth, some being apt to wither
and make soone, as that grasse which is finest, and hath in it least
wéedes, others will be long in making, as that which is full of thicke,
strong, and sower grasses, many wéedes, bunnes, and such like hard
stalkes, which are not easily dried, therefore it is the part of euery
good Husbandman, either by his eye and knowledge to iudge of the nature
of his grasse, or else to follow the customes of the Country and soyle
wherein he liueth, but the first, Knowledge, is the better Science.
But to procéede to my purpose, I will in the natures of two sorts of
grasse, the one fine, the other course, shew you the generall making of
all sorts of Hay.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_make_fine_Hay">To make fine Hay.</span>

<p>First, then for the making of your fine rich grass into Hay, if it grow
in great abundance, thicke and close, and so lieth in the swathe, you
shall haue one with a Pitch-forke to follow the Mowers, and to spread
and throw the grasse thinne abroad, that the ayre and sunne-beames may
passe through it: and this is called in most Countries tedding of Hay.
The next day, after the Sunne hath taken the dewe from the ground, you
shall turne that which the day before you tedded, and then if you haue
any more new mowen, you shall ted it also. The next day following,
as before, when the dewe is from the earth, you shall turne your Hay
againe, and so letting it lye till the Sunne be at his height, begin
to stir it againe, at which time if you finde it is reasonably well
withered, you shal then draw it into windrowes, that is, you shall
marke which way the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span> winde standeth, and the same way that it bloweth,
the same way with Forks &amp; Rakes one after another, gather in the Hay
into long, great, thicke rowes: then you shall make those windrowes
into large Cockes, of which the biggest is euer the best, for they will
defend themselues from raine, if happily any shall fall, whereas the
little small Cocke lying light together, taketh in the raine like a
spunge, and so makes the Hay a great deale much worse then otherwise
it would be; when your Hay is thus set in safe Cocke, you shall let
it rest a day or two, that it may take a little sweat therein, which
will make the Hay wondrous pleasant and swéet, then when the Sunne is
got vp to a pretie height, you shall open those Cockes, and after the
sunne and winde hath passed through them, you may if the grasse be
clean &amp; fine of it selfe, without ranke grasse, load it, and carrie
it either into the Barne, or such other place, as you haue appointed
for the receit thereof: but if it haue any ranke grasse, which you
sée vnwithered amongst it, then you shall make it vp againe into safe
cockes, and so let it rest a day or two more before you leade it away.
And thus much for the making vp of fine Hay.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="To_make_course_Hay">To make course Hay.</span>

<p>Now for the making of course grasse into Hay, which you must suppose to
be grasse growing, in colde, moyst, woodie, and barraine grounds, full
of wéedie, rough, and stumpie hearbage, long in growing, late ere it
can be gathered, and therefore depriued of much of the Sunnes strength,
to swéeten and wither it. This grasse as soone as it hath béene mowne
and tedded, as is before said: the next day you shall make it into
little grasse Cockes, as bigge as little Moale-hilles, and so hauing
layne a day or better, then breake them open, and let them receiue the
sunne and winde, for they will heat and sweat a little in the grasse,
which make it Hay the sooner &amp; better: then after the Sunne hath spent
all his power vpon it, you shall make it vp into little Cockes againe,
putting two of the first Cockes into one, then hauing so layne another
day, breake them open againe, and giue them the Sunne:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span> then make them
vp againe, and put thrée or foure of those Cockes into one, and so let
them lye another day, then breake them open as before, if the Sunne
shine faire, and at euening make them vp againe, putting thrée or foure
of those Cockes into one, and so euery morning after the Sunne is vp
breake them open, and at euening make them vp againe, till you finde
that the Hay is sufficiently well dried, and sweateth no more in the
Cocke: but in the morning when you breake it open it is dry, without
stemme, smoake, or vapour arising from it, which both your hand and
eye may perceiue in the first stirring or mouing, and then you may at
your pleasure leade it home, and house or stacke it as you shall haue
occasion.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Vse_of_Hay_for_cattell">Vse of Hay for cattell to breed or labour with.</span>

<p>Now for the vse of Hay, it is two-folde, that is, either for the
maintainance of bréeding Cattell, or Cattell for labour, or else for
the féeding of Cattell for the Market, or for slaughter: for the
maintainance of bréeding Cattell, or the Cattell which are imployed in
your Plough or other labours, whether it be draught or trauell, you
shall make choise of the swéet, and well-dried Hay, which is of fresh
and gréene colour, well withered, sound, and perfect Hay, though it be
long, loggie, and not excéeding much swéet, it matters not; for being
well Inned and dried, it will serue sufficiently for those purposes:
and with this Hay to mingle sometimes Wheat-straw, Rye-straw, Barly,
or Oate-straw will not be amisse for heilding, or bréede Cattell: but
for worke-beasts, except necessitie constraine, let them haue Hay
simple of it selfe, during the busie time of their worke, but when
they rest, you may vse your discretion. For the times of giuing Hay
or foddering to such Cattell as are in the house, the best is in the
morning before they goe to labour, in the euening when they come from
labour, presently after their drinke, and at night when you goe to bed.
But for those Cattell which goe abroad, as Shéepe, heilding Beasts, and
such like, to fodder them morning and euening, is out and out fully
sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>Now for the vse of Hay for fat cattell, you shall make choyse of the
fruitfullest, swéetest, finest, and shortest Hay you haue, being full
of flowers, pleasant and odoriferous to smell on: and although this
Hay be mixt with some roughnesse, yet it is not the worse, for though
your fat beast make thereof great orts, yet is the losse not great,
for those orts may be giuen to other heilding and hungrie cattell,
which will eate them with great eagernesse. This Hay would in the first
gathering not be withered too sore but so stackt-vp with a little
hartie gréennesse that it may a little mow-burne, and alter the colour
to a Redish brounnesse, but by no meanes so moyst that it may mould,
rot, or putrifie, for that is fulsome and bade, but onely alter the
colour, and therby make the smell swéeter and stronger. This Hay will
entice a beast to eate, and will strengthen and inable his stomacke,
and withall will bréed in him such a drought or thirst, that hardly any
water will quench him, and the Grazier takes it euer for an infallible
signe, that when his beast drinkes much he féeds fast and his tallow
wonderfully increaseth. For the ordinarie times of foddring your fat
cattell, if they be in the stall, and as we say, tyed vp by the head,
the best is in the morning before and after water, at noone; in the
euening before &amp; after water, and late in the night, when you goe
to bed, but if they féede abroad, and take the benefit of Fogge and
after-grasse, then to fodder them Morning, Euening, and high-noone is
fully sufficient.</p>

<p>Here I could speake of Pease-féeding of Shéep, Swine, and other cattel,
eyther at the Trough, Reeke, Stacke, or such like, the seuerall
manner of cratches, fashions of stals, and many other necessary rules
appertaining to this mysterie; but I am against my will confined,
and therefore must referre it to some other occasion, being loath to
spoyle an excellent discourse, with a tale halfe tould, and imperfectly
spoken: And thus much therefore of Meddowes, and these seuerall vses.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap2" src="images/i112.png" alt="">
</div>
<p class="noindent drop-cap2">Of this Theame I haue written a whole (or as some will
suppose many) Histories, yet doubtlesse nothing too much, the cause
is so necessary and commodious: yet this I must let euery Reader
vnderstand, that what I haue herein formerly done, I did for a general
and vncontrollable satisfaction to the whole Kingdome, both the learned
and vnlearned, and as well to satisfie the nicest and most curious
opinion, as the simple and playne dealing creature: whence it came that
I waded Artfully and profoundly into the vttermost secrets of this
knowledge, leauing nothing vnsearcht, or vnset downe, that might any
way tend to the satisfaction of any iudiciall Reader, and therefore
tooke liberty to make a large progresse, without sparing any paynes,
to make my worke absolutely most perfect. But now, hauing onely to
doe with our honest playne English Husbandman, who eyther cannot much
read, or else hath little leasure to read, at most but a little memorie
to bestow vpon his readings; I haue here for his ease both of memory,
readings, and other verations, drawne him such a method for the curing
of all the diseases in cattell, as was neuer yet found out by any man
or Authour whatsoeuer: and is worthy to be preserued to all posterities
for euer and euer.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Horses_diseases_to_be_cured">Horses diseases to be cured with twelue Medicines.</span>

<p>To beginne then first with the Horse, which is the Husbandmans
principallest creature, you shal vnderstand that he hath, of my
knowledge, one hundred and odde diseases or infirmities, besides other
hurts and blemishes, for all which, I haue seuerally shewed seuerall
cures, as may appeare by the volumes which are much too great for any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Husbandman to carry in his braynes, and therefore for his ease I haue
drawne all those hundred and odde sicknesses or sorrances, into twelue,
and will assure euery Husbandman that with these twelue medicines
following, hée shall perfectly cure all the diseases in a Horse,
whatsoeuer.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_inward_sicknesse">Of inward sicknesse.</span>


<p>To procéede then in an orderly manner to the cures: Euery husbandman
must know that all diseases in a horse are inward or outward: inward
as offending the vitall parts, or outward as troubling the members:
to speake then first of inward sicknesse, I will diuide so into two
branches, that is, eyther it offends the heart, or the brayne: If it
offend the heart, we call them, Feauers, Yellowes, <i>Anticor</i>,
consumption of lungs, Liuer, Splene, Gall or other intrals, Wormes,
Fluxes, Belly-bound, and diuers other of like nature: <span class="sidenote" id="The_first_Medicine">The first Medicine.</span>
For any or all
which, you shall first let your Horse bloud in the neck-veine, and
then giue him, during his sicknesse, to drinke, eyther in swéete
Wine or strong Ale or Béere, if Wine a pinte, if Ale or Béere a
quart, two spoonefull of the powder called <i>Diapente</i>, made of
<i>Aristolochia</i> root, <i>Gentiana</i>, <i>Myrrhe</i>, <i>Eboni</i>
and <i>Bachi lauri</i>, of each equall quantitie, and let it be well
brewed together, and doe thus euery Morning fasting, and let the Horse
fast two houres after it.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_second_Medicine">The second Medicine.</span>

<p>If it offend the brayne we call them Appoplexies, Palsies, Staggers,
Colds, Glaunder, Coughes, mourning of the chyne, Migrims, dizzinesse,
and a world of such like: and the cure is to take <i>Assafeteda</i>,
and dissoluing it in Vinegar dip hurds therein, and stop it hard into
his eares for two Mornings together after you haue taken from him great
store of bloud at his necke-veine, and then giue him to drinke, during
his sicknesse, euery Morning a quart of Milke, wherein the white and
rough cankerrous Mosse of an old Oake pale hath béene sodden till the
Milke grow thicke, then strayned &amp; so giuen luke warme, and if you
finde that no heauinesse or dizzinesse appeare in his head, then you
may forbeare the bloud-letting, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span> <i>Assafeteda</i>, but not
otherwise, in any case; and thus assuredly these two medicines alreadie
declared will cure all the inward diseases in a Horse, whatsoeuer.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Of_outward_diseases">Of outward diseases.</span>


<p>Now for outward diseases, they are eyther naturall or accidentall: If
they be naturall, they eyther grow from the generation, or bréede, from
whence a Horse is descended, or else from corruption of foode, or other
vnwholesome kéeping; If they grow from the bréede and generation of
the Horse, we call them the Viues, Wens, Knots, or Swellings about the
throat: <span class="sidenote" id="The_third_medicine">The third medicine.</span>
and for the cure thereof, take a peny-worth of Pepper, beaten
into powder; a spoonefull of swines-grease, the iuyce of one handfull
of Rew, two spoonefuls of Vineger, and mixe them together, and put this
equally into both the Horses eares, and so tye them vp and shake the
eares, that the medicine may sinke downe, and take good store of bloud
from the Horses neck-veine, and temple veines, and vse this medicine
two or thrée mornings together.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_fourth_Medicine">The fourth Medicine.</span>

<p>If they procéede from corruption of foode, or any other vnwholesome
kéeping which corrupteth the bloud, then we call them Impostumations,
Byles, Botches, Fistulaes, Polemill, and such like: and the cure is, to
take the loame of an old mudde wall, strawes and all, but let there be
no Lime amongst it, and boyle this loame with strong Vineger, till it
be like a Pultus, and as hot as the Horse can abide it, apply it to the
sore place, and it will not onely draw it to a head, and breake it, but
also draw it, search it, and heale it.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_fift_Medicine">The fift Medicine.</span>

<p>There be also other diseases which procéed from naughtie foode, and
the corruption of blood, and we call them Farcies, Scabs, Mangie,
Scratches, Paynes, Mallanders, Sellanders, and all of such like nature,
and the cure is first to slit the hard knots, or rubbe off the scurfe,
and make the sore places raw: then take yellow <i>Arsnicke</i> beaten
to powder, and mixe it well with fresh grease, and then therewith
annoynt the sore places all ouer, which done, tye vp the Horses head,
so as he may not knappe or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span> bite himselfe, and so let him stand an
houre or two: then take strong old Pisse warmde, and therewith bathe
and wash the Horse all ouer, and so put him to his meat: and in this
manner dresse the Horse or beast thrée or foure mornings, and it will
be sufficient; onely you must not fayle to take from him good store of
bloud at his necke vaine.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_sixt_Medicine">The sixt Medicine.</span>

<p>Now if his diseases procéed from accidentall causes, as from wounds,
Bruises, Straynes, Galles, hurts in the Eyes, excretions, or broken
bones, then you shall to euery one of these take these seueral
medicines which follow: as first, if they be wounds, in what sort
soeuer taken or receiued, you shall take <i>Turpentine</i>, Waxe, and
hogs-grease, of each a like quantity, and melting them together into a
salue, dresse the wound therewith, and it will heale it, how great or
little soeuer.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_seuenth_Medicine">The seuenth Medicine.</span>

<p>If they be bruises, whether gotten by stroake, naughtie Saddles, or
other rushes, from whence procéedeth many times old, putrified &amp; most
ranckorous vlcers, you shall first if the tumor be onely swelled and
not broken, apply vnto it the fourth medicine of Loame and Vingar, but
if it be an open old ranckorous vlcer, you shall take Hogs-grease,
Turpentine, Waxe, and Verdigrease, of each a like quantitie, and being
well mixt, and incorporated together, dresse the sore therewith, till
it be whole, for this medicine will abate and kéepe downe any spungie
or naughtie dead flesh which arises and kéepes the sore from healing,
and may therefore alwayes be vsed in such like cases, whether the sore
be new or old.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_eight_Medicines">The eight Medicines.</span>

<p>If they be straynes eyther of ioynts or sinewes in what part or member
soeuer it be, old or new, take strong Vinegar, Patch-grease, and
Wheat-branne, and boyle them together till they be thick like a Pultus,
and then apply it very hot to the strayne, Morning and Euening, and it
is a most certayne cure, and will kéepe the member from growing foule,
knotted, or gourded, and will also take away all swellings or paynes of
the limbes whatsoeuer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_ninth_Medicine">The ninth Medicine.</span>

<p>If they be Galles, of what kinde or nature soeuer, whether on the
backe, limbes, or any other outward part of the bodie, you shal take
first fresh Butter scalding hot, and with it first bathe and wash the
sore, then take thicke Creame, &amp; mixing it with the Soote of a Chimney
till it be thicke, like a salue, with the same annoynt the sore place
Morning and Euening, and it will cure it without any feare of dead
flesh: if you doe strow vpon the sore the powder of Rossen it will be
good also.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_tenth_Medicine">The tenth Medicine.</span>

<p>If they be any hurts in the eyes, as strokes, inflamations,
Pinne-webbe, Canker, or any other mischiefe whatsoeuer, you shall then
take true ground-Iuie, which otherwise is called of some Ale-hoofe, and
beating a good handfull thereof in a morter, with a spoonefull or two
of white Rosewater, or the water of Eye-bright, then strain it through
a cleane wet cloath, and with that water dresse the sore eye Morning
and Euening: or if you can conueniently thrée or foure times a day,
for the oftner is the better, and it will without all fayle cure any
sore eye in the world whatsoeuer, eyther of man or beast, or any other
creature.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_eleuenth_Medicine">The eleuenth Medicine.</span>

<p>If they be excretions of bones, as Splents, Spauens, Curbs, Ringbones,
or such like, in what part or member soeuer they be, you shall then
take white <i>Arsnicke</i>, beaten or ground to fine powder, and
making a little slit vpon the head of the excretion, the length of a
Barly corne, or very little more, yet in any waies downe déepe to the
excretion, &amp; then with the poynt of your knife put the <i>Arsnicke</i>
vpon the excretion, and so let the Horse stand with his head tied vp
for two houres at least, for in that time the greatest anguish will
be gone, and then put him vnto his meate, and in thrée or foure dayes
after the excretion will fall away of it selfe; and then with a little
swéet Butter you may cure the sore, which will not be great.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="The_twelfth_Medicine">The twelfth Medicine.</span>

<p>If they be broken bones, or bones out of ioynt, you shall after you
haue placed them in their due place, first annoynt them with the Oyle
of Mallowes, or for want of it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span> warme Patch-grease, and then clap
about them a plaster made of Pitch, Rossen, and Masticke, and so with
soft and flat splents, so splent the member, as it may not moue, and
so let it rest nine dayes ere you dresse it againe, and in any case
so sling the Horse or Beast that he may not during that time, put his
member to the ground, which a little diligence and payne will easily
doe.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Diseases_in_the_feete">Diseases in the feete.</span>

<p>If your Horse haue any infirmitie in his hooues as quitter-bone,
ouer-reach, pricke, crowne scabbe, rotten frush, or any such vlcerous
disease, you shall first lay it open, and then heale it with the
seuenth Medicine. But if it be foundring, fretteshing, or such like,
then you shall first pare all his hooues cleane ouer, so thinne that
you may discerne the quicke all ouer, then let him bloud at the toes,
and take great store of bloud from him, but in any case cut not the
veine in sunder: then take the sixt medicine and, being boyling hot
(after hollow shoes haue béene tackt on his féete) with Flaxe hurds
dipt therein, stoppe all the soales of his féete vp hard, and thus
doe twice in sixe dayes, and it will bring his féete to their full
perfection againe, without any great losse or trouble.</p>

<span class="sidenote" id="Diseases_in_the_priuie_parts">Diseases in the priuie parts, or for stifling.</span>

<p>As for the common infirmities in a Horses priuy parts, which are
swellings, inflammations, incording, &amp; such like, you shall but only
swimme your horse in cold water Morning and Euening, and it is a
present helpe, both for them, or the stifling of a horse in his hinder
ioynt: Thus you sée these twelue medicines will sufficiently cure all
the diseases in Horse or Beast whatsoeuer, which who so will not carry
in his memory, he is worthy now and then to be punisht for his sloath,
and sometimes to suffer losse, which may make him more industrious to
studie for his owne good and profit. And thus much for the cure of
diseases.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
